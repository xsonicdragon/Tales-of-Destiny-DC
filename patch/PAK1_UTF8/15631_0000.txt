<Stahn>, do you cook for yourself? 
[ENDBLOCK]
My sister does most of the housework, 
so I don't usually, but... 
[ENDBLOCK]
...Oh yeah! There was this one time grandpa 
and sis slept in, and I made them some porridge. 
[ENDBLOCK]
That was nice of you! 
They must have been delighted! 
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, they were pretty happy, but 
they told me to never do it again. 
[ENDBLOCK]
"Any more and we'd fear for our lives", 
they said. They were probably exaggerating. 
[ENDBLOCK]
...Something tells me they weren't.<x00>
