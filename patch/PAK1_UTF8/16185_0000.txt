King <Woodrow>~! I need
to tell you something!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, <Chelsea>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you see, uhm...
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that <Stahn> is trying
to buy someone to be his wife...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lately, <Philia>'s been mumbling
about his wife costing a fortune!
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha, I don't think
that's the case at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't buy someone to be your wife.
You must have misunderstood.
[ENDBLOCK]
Blugh! This is no laughing matter!
[ENDBLOCK]
...But maybe your right. I might
have jumped to a conclusion.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess I shoulda looked before I leaped!
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hmm...<x00>
