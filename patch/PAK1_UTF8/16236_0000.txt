The beach up North, huh...
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
How about if nothing's there, we go
for a dip in the ocean before we return?
[ENDBLOCK]
Why would there be an
unkown monster there...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, but wait, Master <Lion>
left his swimsuit at home...
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, this is a problem...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe I could just throw
Chal into the ocean, then leave...
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's a great idea!
[ENDBLOCK]
...Wait, no it's not!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, now!
Don't joke around like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Who says I'm joking?
I'm trying to focus, here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sheesh, Master <Lion>...
You need to relax a little...<x00>
