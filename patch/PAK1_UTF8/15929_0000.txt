Chaltier was still with him...
Why did this have to happen??
[ENDBLOCK]
Even above his duty as a Swordian,
he chose to remain at Leon's side...
[ENDBLOCK]
An extremely humanlike decision. It would be
easy to just brush it off as a foolish act, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like that is
something we cannot do.
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe this raises one of the
biggest questions about us Swordians...
[ENDBLOCK]
Are we, or are we not, humans at heart?
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm...
