Even if Tiberius the Great is gone,
it will be hard to clean up after him.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. I'd like to leave the hassle
to my dad, brother, and Fayte, but I don't
know... what will happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think will happen to
Aquaveil in the future?
[ENDBLOCK]
Tiberius has no heir, so it will be
difficult for the Toukei domain to survive.
[ENDBLOCK]
I think this one incident might be a good
opportunity to talk about unifying Aquaveil.<x00>
