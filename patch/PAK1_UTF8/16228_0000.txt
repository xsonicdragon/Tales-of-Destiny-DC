...
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter?
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought for sure all I wanted
was to surpass Hugo, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lately, I've been questioning
what it is I actually want...
[ENDBLOCK]
Has all my time with <Stahn>
and the others made me weak...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Not at all. The opposite, in fact.
[ENDBLOCK]
You've grown very
strong, indeed, Master <Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have I really, though...?
[ENDBLOCK]
You have.
[ENDBLOCK]
You're already past the point
of worrying about Master Hugo.
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you...
[ENDBLOCK]
...really think so...?
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm certain that when Master Hugo sees
how tough you've gotten, even he will go...
[ENDBLOCK]
"I'm no match for you, <Lion>!"
[ENDBLOCK]
...or something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think he'd
say something like that...
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! And Marian will be all...
[ENDBLOCK]
"Oh, Master <Lion>! Before I knew it,
you grew up into such a strong young man!"
[ENDBLOCK]
...Maybe? I mean, certainly!!
[ENDBLOCK]
D-Don't be stupid!
[ENDBLOCK]
Marian would never...!
[ENDBLOCK]
So! Let's finish this mission up,
so you can return home in triumph!
[ENDBLOCK]
Right...let's go!<x00>
