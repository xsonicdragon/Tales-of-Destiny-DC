Question!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ready!
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on a second. Can I say one thing first?
[ENDBLOCK]
It's about the question with Michel from earlier...

Aquaveil as a political prisoner.
[ENDBLOCK]
Eeh? I've never seen that theory
mentioned in any documents.
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never heard such a thing either.
[ENDBLOCK]
You doubt it? But it's true.
[ENDBLOCK]
You two are certainly knowledgeable...
[ENDBLOCK]
But the truth of history and what's recorded
in books are often quite different.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's certainly strange.
Where did <Johnny> find out about this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the records about Michel Shiden say...
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah...<x00>
