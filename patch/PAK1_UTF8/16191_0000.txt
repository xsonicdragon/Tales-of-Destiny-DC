[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, whoa, that was a close call,
wasn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
You scared me, Lord <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
...Why are you hugging <Woodrow>, <Kongman>?
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that? Me?
Hugging who...?
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell! You've got me
right in front of you, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell?	Why, why!?
Why do I have the body of a little kid?
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh no! This body is disgusting~!
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I now have the body of <Rutee>...
What should I say to Dalis?...
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, <Mary> is more than I imagined...
She's a married woman alright...
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, calm down.
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I have <Stahn>'s body now!
What do I do? Goddess help me...
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, I didn't know <Philia>'s clothes were
like this. Let's see, underneath this is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, please don't!
[ENDBLOCK]
This isn't going to end well.
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Philia>？
[ENDBLOCK]
...Oh my god, I don't know what's going on!
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's who, after all?
[ENDBLOCK]
So, please stop!
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm in <Johnny>'s...
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my god! What the hell is going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not the kind of thing
you show to people.
[ENDBLOCK]
So, that's what I've got in me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that you, <Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't look at my body!
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! <Stahn>！
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you dare lower your nose
and look at <Philia>'s body!
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I'm not telling you not to
look at it forever...
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm, there are some strange phenomena
in the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
How did this happen?...
[ENDBLOCK]
What a weird bunch...
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, isn't this all part of the fun?
[ENDBLOCK]
Somebody help us...
[ENDBLOCK]
...Even with her faults,
<Mary>'s really awesome.
[ENDBLOCK]
I think, therefore I am, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep going back to Dalis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh, it's just too much...
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm starting to feel a bit frustrated.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to try to get back to Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
On the off chance that Dalis
is happy or something...
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't be Lord <Woodrow>'s
bride like this!
[ENDBLOCK]
That could be interesting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
What are we supposed to do?...
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think, <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
If I told you I'd become
a girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
What are we going to do!
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't we just live
with it for a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
No, hold on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, you stupid, stupid idiot!
[ENDBLOCK]
People will be surprised.
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that even possible,
if you think about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
After all of this...
[ENDBLOCK]
...I have now a body with
a pitiful power level.
[ENDBLOCK]
If it makes Dalis happy,
it's worth it in the end.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm still a champion, man!
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't just slap him!
[ENDBLOCK]
I am the champion～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Boo!
[ENDBLOCK]
When you're a champion,
you're a champiooon~♪<x00>
