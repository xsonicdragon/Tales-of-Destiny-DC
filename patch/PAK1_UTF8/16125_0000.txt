When <Lion> is watching us, we're
stronger than usual.
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder why?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell, you're just watching.
Just look at yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
If you've got a problem with me, finish
fighting before saying it to my face.
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, yeah, I know!
[ENDBLOCK]
The anger that arises is vented on the

[ENDBLOCK]
I see...<x00>
