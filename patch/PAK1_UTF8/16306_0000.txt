Inside Trash Mountain....
[ENDBLOCK]
There were some rocks with gas
spewing out of them.
[ENDBLOCK]
I've seen them, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
If we use the Sorcerer's Ring in that place,
it might explode.
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll have to be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's blow it up with a bang.
[ENDBLOCK]
W-what the...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
If we can reduce the number of gas jets,
we might be able to go deeper.
[ENDBLOCK]
An explosion won't work then.
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
It might be dangerous,
but it's worth a try.<x00>
