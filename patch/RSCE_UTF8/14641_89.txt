<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
For what?
Of course, to bring the glory of the 
heavenly world back to this world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
A new war for heaven and earth 
has just begun!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is the Eye of Atamoni there?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's just a 3D image. 
It's probably a representation of the 
current state of the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
This is it, ground troops.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've come out here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't expect you to fly into Belcrant.
I'm impressed with your bravery.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
So much for your ambition, <Hugo>.
I won't let you do what you want 
any more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The aide you relied on is no longer
with us. You're all that's left.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you ready?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't stand a chance.
This is the end of the war 
between heaven and earth!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha-ha-ha!
Come on, you can't win!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's your innocence.
Didn't <Lion> tell you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did you do to <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how powerful I can be.
Did you not hear that at all?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I remember how that young swordsman
cowered on the floor and begged for my
forgiveness!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't insult <Lion>! He would 
never do such a thing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
... Now that we've met,
I'll give you one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a touchy subject for
<Lion>, though, so I didn't 
bother to bring it up. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordians...
You'll recognize this sword!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's ...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh no, no way...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said <Belserius>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lost during the last war between heaven
and earth. It's the Sixth Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is it there, that's...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Belserius> was secretly transported
to the surface by the remnants of the
Heavenly Army.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what was lost
in Calvalese, I got!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
But <Belserius> must have been 
damaged in that battle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll know if it's broken if you 
try your hand at it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Belserius>, is that really you?
If you can hear me, answer me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you ready, you insects?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take the blade of <Belserius>, 
and be done with it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Beh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now it's over.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't think you could go toe-to-toe
with <Belserius>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, don't you think there's something
wrong with the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. The glow is growing stronger!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Look, everyone!
More light from <Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's happened to <Belserius>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you still trying to stand?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
... Don't think that you can defeat 
me with this feeble attack.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter how much the lowly
people of earth may exclaim, they
will never be able to compete with
me, the supreme being!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as I have <Belserius>!
I am invincible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You... Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something different 
with him since we first met.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you really <Hugo>? You're really
someone else, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> What are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How's about it? Answer me!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. ... For a lowly earthling, 
you have pretty good instincts.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, my God, that voice?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that you've realized it, 
I'll show you who I really am!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Aaaaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
----1------

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nonsense, that's ...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!	I have descended!
I, the King of Heaven, have descended
once again to this world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why, why, why!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can <Miktran> just 
materialize like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
The technology of our celestial
army was superior to that of you
earthlings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you have a material body and
the Eye of Atamoni, you can even 
come back to life!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying that this is also 
the Eye of Atamoni's power?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you call a human 
body a material...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all your doing, isn't it.
It was all your doing, wasn't it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
And if that's the case?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordians!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
You thought you were the ones 
who were supposed to win the war, 
didn't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was sweet!	I was irradiating 
my own personality to <Belserius> 
at that time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
And he had taken <Belserius> for 
himself and was hiding in it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was humiliating to pretend to be 
broken, but it also gave me some 
interesting knowledge.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
The former personality of <Belserius>
is quite the brainiac, isn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean Carlyle...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Carlyle, huh?
Hmm, well, okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how you were able to 
develop the mirror barrier!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
When <Hugo> found me, I took
over his consciousness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
And all this time, I've been using 
them as my puppets.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> is just a lowly earthling.
Without me, he wouldn't have made
it this far!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll never forgive me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't mean to speak for <Hugo>, 
but... I will never forgive you for
what you've done!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm... ...
Looks like the Belcrant
is ready to launch.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
The outer shell will now be 
complete. The filthy earth will
be closed in darkness!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Under my rule as King, a paradise
for the Chosen One will be established
in the heavens!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not gonna let you do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, futile attempts.
Then you should see this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Light from <Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a lot of pressure. I don't 
know about this <Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's play with it, just to get
it off our shoulders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care how many Swordian
Masters there are, you can't stand 
against me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell?

<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stupid. This is how it should be...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are not on the same level 
you and me. Now you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni is on...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Watch as the earth is shrouded 
in eternal darkness!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Belcrant, fire!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Noooo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The outer shell is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bahaha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you done!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bahaha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've come so far...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dammit!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha! It's a complete victory
for my heavenly army!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to finish you off.
You should be grateful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I, the King of Heaven, will 
deal with you in person!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
First you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're giving me special treatment?
I'm so grateful, it brings tears to
my eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> has always been concerned
about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even after taking his body, <Hugo>
still had some consciousness left.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how I know. The man was in
a constant state of distress.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was wondering if there 
was any way he could tell you
that he was your father.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what lowborn people think!
I used to mock him all the time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
And there's nothing you can do 
about it, is there? That's too bad.
Ha-ha-ha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be stupid!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that celestial beings 
are no different from earthly beings,
but not you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have no humanity!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's disgusting to laugh at how 
families care for each other!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you be better 
than the humans on Earth?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut your mouth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
You cheeky little worm.
I'll deal with you next.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh-uh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, get a grip!
<Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, are you ready?
<Rutee> Katrea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> Gilchrist's, dear daughter!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mu...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on...?
I can't move.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>... Can you 
hear me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's <Hugo>'s voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's happening?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't have much time. 
You need to get out of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to detach the Belcrant now.
Go straight to surface.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
You! <Hugo>'s consciousness 
remains in his body! Impudent...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>... I see...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't hold on much longer...
Hurry up... Before I'm gone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so glad you called me... father..
That made me happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You didn't have any...
I didn't... give you anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, let's do what <Hugo> says.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you... and...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>... stay safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no, no!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father... Father!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
