The rats took the energy unit.

It's because the entire

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
We can't open it until it's restored.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How do we do that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll have to recharge
the main system.
[ENDBLOCK]

I believe the main system room
is on the other side of here.

[ENDBLOCK]
Look, it's the glowing red one

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to catch that thing and
connect it to the main system.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's kind of like catching bugs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, it's open!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
This will take us to the other

is Cloudius.

It seems that Deimos's systems
have been restored and the warp
device can now be used.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
With this warp device, you can
get all the way back to Deimos's
transporter room.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I guess we can use it 
to get back to Ignasea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, that's what I mean.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Warp devices that connect these
transporter devices to the entrance
are found in all aerial cities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It should come in handy when
we have a lot of strong enemies
and not much time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
But don't forget the most
important thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know. Now we're getting out of here,
and we're going to Cloudius.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. You can use this warp 
device when you return to Ignasea.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
