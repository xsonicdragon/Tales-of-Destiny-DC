You see, I have
a younger brother...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? Well, OK. Go on.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister

The other day, I overheard
mom and dad talking about him..
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
..about how he might
not be my real brother..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really, now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, let me tell you this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>

Even if it's not by blood, 
he's still your brother.

I don't really get it...

hurt or anything?

Yeah. My brother and I were fine.

Also, I thought about what you
said, and I get it, now!

<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well now, you're
pretty smart, huh!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I was more worried about my brother
than myself when I was running from
the monsters.

This means we're
really family, right??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you got it!

Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right.

Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If he see's you, he'll have 
an interesting reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
He seemed to be in a rush, so it 
will be impossible to find him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Then you should find 
somebody who might know him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'll mistake 
you for him.

this person were exchanging letters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, I'm supposed to meet
him for the first time today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you mistook
her for <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
So, let's go somewhere
to relax, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
For sure! I'm  so sorry to have
inconvenience the two of you
with this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's strange, I feel a little
bit sad, don't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because, a long time ago
she told me that she liked me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, uh, Mr. <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wo-women can forget about the
past without a second thought...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-on the contrary, men seem to
dwell on the past forever you see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
T-this man's behavior is commonly
di-disliked by wo-women...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I see. Well then, I guess I won't
give it a second thought too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, no, but...
that's disliked by women as well...

The gap between the rich and the poor

harder against Oberon.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure Ms. <Ilene> is disappointed.
[ENDBLOCK]

It's times like this that
we need to unite...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Without Ms. <Ilene>,
it would be very difficult.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
