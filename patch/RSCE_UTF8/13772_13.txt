Hey, long time no see! 
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that. I think you have me
confused with someone else
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you! Come on, come
on...tell me another story.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure your
someone else?

[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about that.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it. Now you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does that person really look
that much like me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's a good analogy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If someone who knew him saw
it, I think they would have
the same interesting reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
He seemed to be in a hurry
though, so I don't think it would
be possible to track him down.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right!�@Then find someone
who knows about him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure everyone will
think it's him.

you the other day?
[ENDBLOCK]

I'm a bit of a hiragana these

practicing swordsmanship.

Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I want my son to study more just
than sword fighting...
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
That trio of "self-proclaimed"
heroes is one hell of a bunch of
crooks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, she and your father
were so enthralled...
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
If this happens, I won't be able
to talk about swordsmanship or
study.
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Those three "self-proclaimed"
heroes, weren't they really
trying to escape?
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I was relieved to hear that the
soldiers from the castle
would be coming.
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Leader's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought that those three "self-
proclaimed" brave men were
not enough

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
