[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, sister...what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!? 
Don't suprise me like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you so suprised?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you here to see the mayor?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
We shouldn't talk about that here.
Let's talk at the orphanage.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, come with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, what about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell is going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell us what exactly is going on
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, the orphanage has 
decided to put on a play for their
upcoming recital.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that got to do 
with the mayor?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, just hear me out.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you already know
that we're not getting along with 
the mayor and his wife, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone in the city knows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the mayor and his wife are
going to be there for the recital.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
So I am hoping tht they watch the
children and that helps to repair 
our relationship with them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
But it seems that the mayor's wife
is trying to sabotage us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, are you planning on going
to the mayor's house?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, but I don't know what to say...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's for sure. You can't just go
in and ask,"Are you trying to
sabotage us?"
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
So <Rutee>.
I have a favor to ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you find out what the 
mayor's wife is planning?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you and <Rutee> up to?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
We aren't up to anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister, may I ask you a favor?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I'm on my way.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
This will be our little secret.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for taking care of this
for me, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, just a minute...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What should we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
For now, let's go to 
the mayor's house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if we have to...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold up! Can't you hear voices
from inside the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're right! I do hear something...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't make out what they 
are saying though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, why do you look like you're
having so much fun?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was thinking we are totally spies.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be ridiculous...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...but if you were a spy, you would
be able to hear them, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong with you <Philia>？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you hear something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can hear voices coming
from inside the hou
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't tell what the hell 
they are saying though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we could hear what
they are saying...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Could you please keep it
down for a moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps <Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>.
Be quiet!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I also need you to be quiet, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can hear a woman's voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That must be the mayor's wife.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The recital...is ready...
now...the orphanage...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...can be crushed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What exactly is she up to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I couldn't make that out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hate to break it to you, but you
guys are going to have to stick
around for a little while longer. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to protect the orphanage at
all costs. I can't let the mayor's
wife get away with this. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. So the mayor's wife
is planning something. 。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
She is, but I don't know what
her plan is for the orphanage.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, I...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, don't be hard on yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
There will be a lot of people coming
to the show. They won't be able to
get away with anything to rash.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And we will be here with you too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. If anything happens,
we can intervene quickly. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, tomorrow is the recital.
Please, spend the night here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It hasn't started yet...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. The children just 
need more time to get ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, my God! The children are gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where the hell did they go?!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know. But considering the
last time I saw them...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think they could've 
gone very far.
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
Is everything alright?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, the children are gone...
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, dear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't act so surprised. You're the
one responsible for taking them!
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you accuse me of this.
I'm the mayor's wife!
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
What a rude young lady. Must not
have been raised very well.
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, there is something 
I forgot to mention.
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
If today's recital were to be a
failure, we would have no choice 
but to stop funding the orphanage.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't be serious!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
This can't be real!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way. You can't do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
So sorry I forgot to mention that.
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I am looking forward to
the recital today. Hahaha.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's clearly involved.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not important right now.
We don't have much time before
the recital starts.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
The children's costumes are
also missing. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
If they are wearing their costumes,
they must be somewhere in town. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
There are four of us. Let's hurry
up and find them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...This can't be happening...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
We couldn't get back in time...
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm really sorry to hear that.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
But if the orphanage shuts down...
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. Once we demolish this
place, we will replace it with the
most magnificent museum.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you dare say that!
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't matter what I say.
There is no place for you here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all our fault...If we hadn't been 
playing hide and seek...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't blame yourselves. 
It wasn't your fault.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>, does this mean we 
are going to lose our house?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
That can't happen! I want to 
stay with everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about.
It will be okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you don't have a home
anymore, you can survive if
you all stick together. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, there are some things that
you can't do on your own, but
together you can do anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, we are a family, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
There, you see? Let's believe in
the sister's words, alright?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah...I only need my family!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Me, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
How long can you keep pretending
to be one big happy family?!
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I suggest you prepare to 
leave here at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
That's enough!
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
Hello dear, what a suprise!！
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I know what you are planning...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It is too painful to stand by and
let this happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
We love children.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you lie to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not lying. We really wanted
to have a child of our own...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
However, we were never blessed
with a child of our own.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
When I see children who have been
abandoned like they have...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't help but think we are no
better than the parents that 
abandoned them in the first place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if we even deserve
to have a family!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
...I just can't help but blame
myself for letting this happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
Honey...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I will not longer bother with this
place. You may stay in your home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, dear. Let's go home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, Mr. Mayor...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me teach you something.
You said that you wondered
if you deserved to have a family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you seriously believe that, we
might not deserve a family either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
In spite of that...
we are still a family.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you trying to say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm asking you to visit
whenever you want.
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
You want us to take care of these
children for you? After all that 
we have done?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course we can forgive you. We
only have one condition.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
...one condition?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
You must promise to truly be
a part of our family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must know. Family must forgive
each other no matter what.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You will be their real children, not 
a replacement child. Understand? 
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
She's my new mom!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, mom.
Let's go and play!
[ENDBLOCK]
町長の奥さん
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The sisters are at home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you're back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay safe!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay safe, Miss <Rutee>！
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Have a good trip!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Miss <Rutee>!
I knew you'd come back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to miss you, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I promise I won't cry anymore.
I believe in you, <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I promise I won't cry anymore.
I will work hard just like my 
big sister.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home big sister!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, let's play!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck, and be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>!
Why is the sky so weird?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, what's wrong with the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We will be fine. You don't
have to worry about us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...and so the brave prince married
the princess and they lived
happily ever after.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The End.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>, I want another story!
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope the next one is about
slaying monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I want another story about
a prince and a princess.
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, that's not fair.
We just heard a story about that!
[ENDBLOCK]
I want a story about a prince and 
a princess. Prince and Princess!
Prince and Princess!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, settle down. No need to fight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whether you're a monster slayer or
a princess, it's time to go to bed. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Awwww!!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Awwww!!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I've heard that story before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nevermind, it's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter? Why won't you
talk to me about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Dymlos>. Do you think it's 
a good idea to take <Rutee> along?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course it is. Why would you ask
such a question?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It just seems that <Rutee> really 
enjoys spending time with these kids.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let your emotions get the 
best of you. Think about the 
gravity of the situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. And besides, after
coming all this way it would be a
shame to leave empty handed. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you doing here? I thought
I told you we were done with
our arrangment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, there has been a change...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I suppose I could bill you for 
my time. You'll have to pay my
fee PLUS interest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, I need a favor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You need <Atwight>'s and my help,
isn't that right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How did you know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I saw you with <Dymlos>, I
knew something was wrong.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a matter of fact...the Eye of 
Atamoni has been stolen by some
unknown force.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? <Atwight>、where are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The warehouse.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-Warehouse...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> is probably nearby. That guy
is so pathetic.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that <Lion> went missing.
I hope nothing bad happened to him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's done is done. 
Now let's go and take it back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you want to go...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, don't be such a downer.
You'll get to travel with me again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aren't you happy about that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course I am...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then it's settled.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go fetch <Atwight>. I probably 
should say goodbye to everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oi, you rascals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to be heading out for a 
while. Keep an eye on each other.
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Again?
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll miss you, Miss <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be back soon. Just be patient!
Also, do what the sisters say.
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, okay...
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back soon and be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, now that that's taken care of
we can head out whenever we want.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're in for it now, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah. We must get to Seinegald Castle
as quickly as possible. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where are the others?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are supposed to meet up
at the square. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's get going then.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>, you're back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Souvenirs?	Where are they?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well well, aren't you so
full of energy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. I brought enough for
everyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurray!
[ENDBLOCK]
Yay!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, hey, mister! Let's play!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! You shouldn't play with
strangers! Big sis told me so!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
So whatcha here for, mister?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm looking for a young woman
who reported a monster sighting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! You mean big sis! She
went out with the nuns this morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's too bad. Do you know 
when they'll be back?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...I dunno!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
We were there when 
the monster was seen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's true! We were
going to the beach!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The beach? You mean
the one north of here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
North? Hey, what's North?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, North! It's like,
uhh...up in the sky!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you know everything!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Moving on...Did you happen
to notice anything odd?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You bet I did! I saw some
big ol' building on an
island across the water!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
A building...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I saw it too!
It looked super old and stuff!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see...I'll need
to look into that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! Mister! You should
play with us, next time!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back soon!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
