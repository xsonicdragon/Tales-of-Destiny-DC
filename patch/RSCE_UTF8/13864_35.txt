[ENDBLOCK]
... What do you mean...?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You look the part,
are you adventurers too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>

Ah, Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, would
you have a look at this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
An adventure friend of mine
sent me this picture.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
And somehow, a different adventurer
friend of mine sent me another picture
that looks just like the first one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there's any
meaning to this picture...
I sure don't get it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If you have time, would you go look
around for this place?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know where it is, so use
this picture as reference.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll stay here for a while longer,
if you want to look at the picture
again just come to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, if you find anything in this
place, come and tell me. I'll reward you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll also introduce you to my friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
The three of them are currently on
Cyril, Straylize Temple, and Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh? Are you <Stahn> by any chance?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, yes...
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Has an adventurer asked you
to look at a picture recently?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm his friend and this
is the picture I took.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to see this picture
again come see me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Look at the picture again?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, so that's what happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Here's your reward.
Please take it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take my leave now.
See you.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll refer you to my friends,
the ones who took the pictures.
[ENDBLOCK]
They are in Cyril, Straylize Temple,
and Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll refer you to my friends,
the ones who took the pictures.
[ENDBLOCK]
They are in Neuestadt, Straylize Temple,

<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, thank you for your hard work
escorting the Bishop here the other day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was nothing. Is the temple
reconstruction going well?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, it is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...At least, that's what
I want to say. We still
have a lot of problems...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Above all, the
biggest issue is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...The fact that the Eye of Atamoni
will no longer be housed here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought that the existence of
the Eye of Atamoni was a strict secret?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that's the problem.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There are some in the higher ranks
in the temple who see it as the 
reason the temple even exists.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is just one theory, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's possible that this temple was
built specifically to
protect the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that true?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even I don't
know for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, I don't
think anyone does.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, this has become a problem
that has shaken the 
temple to it's very core...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If this keeps up, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What will you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, what do you
think about this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you someone who wants
to help people by protecting the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Or someone who wants to help the
temple by protecting other people?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...I just...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just believe that Atamoni exists
within the hearts of the people...
That it gives them the strength to live...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, in that case, it doesn't
matter what the others think.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell me, who told you
to say all of that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nobody! I'm speaking
my own mind, here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe! Thank you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, I'll just
have to keep my chin up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If someone I didn't know
said that to me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm not sure it would
have cheered me up so much. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph...whatever you say...

Oh no, it's fun to be free
and travel around the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Do you know
someone like him?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone wants to travel in search
of freedom at least once in their life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
From the looks of
it, you're not free.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
A free identity is a good thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! ...At last, at last, you've seen 
all that this world has to offer!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Excellent! You're worthy
to bear this name!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
No, you're the only ones!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Congratulations!
[NatuRangers]!

I never imagined that
this day would come.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a good experience for me
to take back to my homeland.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You found the [Celestial Hand Mirror]?
Real convenient tool it is, that one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
So you found the [Liarpecker]?
Oh, I see marks on your forehead!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
No wait, sorry. Must've
been my imagination.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
So here's what
I've got for you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I spotted a thin beam of light
stretching toward the sky
over near Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess it must finally
be my time to go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just kidding, relax.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard about a peculiar little
critter down at the village on
the way to Straylize Temple
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
that all the kids hate.
I'm already a big fan.

or you are free to go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Just, don't forget I was here,
even if some time has passed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's <Philia>, isn't it?
And there with her is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, I would like to thank
Bishop <Ayles> for his great
help on that occasion.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
This is another test that the Goddess has
given me. That's what I've decided to believe.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
May the Goddess bless all of
you who're facing hardships.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
For a while, this place was off-limits.
Did something happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm amazed at the voices coming down
from the sky and the strange webs...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Goddess Atamoni, please deliver us...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So they found a way to go up to the
sky. This must be another blessing
from the goddess Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good day to you, Ms. <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the Straylize temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Ms. <Philia>, what's that
thing floating in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that thing
floating in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's getting colder... Is it because
there's no more sunshine?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck, Ms. <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck to you!

Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been rumored for a long
time that this temple holds
a great treasure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? The treasure is
in reality a giant lens?
Oh, wow!
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
What a terrible disaster.
I didn't see it coming.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
The number of monsters is
increasing, we'll be stranded
at the temple for a long time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hello, <Lion>.
What brings you to the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm waiting for the Bishop,
but he hasn't arrived yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't forget what you said.
I'll do my best!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
