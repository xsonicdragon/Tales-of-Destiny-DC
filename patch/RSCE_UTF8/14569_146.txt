<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the heart of Helraios.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. In the back here is the technical
research facility that we need.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a long time, Mr. <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>... I'm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't want to see 
you again like this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why, <Ilene>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
"I want to create a world where no one
hates each other, where everyone laughs
with each other."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what you said before! 
Where did you go wrong!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you know what's 
going on in Neuestadt now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Neuestadt...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
The gap between the rich and
the poor has only grown since
you were there last.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
This causes constant strife, 
and people's minds are filled
with doubt and envy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you've traveled the world
and seen similar situations in many
places, haven't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
In order to realize the ideal, 
everything must be brought 
to nothing once and for all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I realized that and agreed 
with <Hugo>'s idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for the advice. But your
words are so shallow, I can't help
but laugh.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of ideal is that? You're just
running away from the painful truth
of reality by saying that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your nonsense will never
reach our hearts!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. We've already passed 
the point of discussion, haven't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No!	Miss <Ilene>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our paths... are no longer the same!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're strong. <Stahn>, you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>... Let's start over again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Like how we promised in our competition, 
let's make our ideals a reality!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll help you with anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You haven't changed at all 
from the last time I saw you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you've seen a lot of 
bad things and suffered a lot.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure it's because of the 
promise I made to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been thinking a lot about 
what I should do since then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
"I want to create a world where no
one hates each other, where everyone
laughs with each other."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you really think you can do that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if we can't, we're going to try!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because that's what it means to 
aim for the ideal, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're refreshingly straightforward.
I guess that's your charm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, don't ever lose 
that innocence of yours.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
That straightforwardness of yours
may open doors to a new world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>, what are you doing...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm done here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>, wait!
<Ilene>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's been silent the entire time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had a hard time getting him to behave.
What a troublesome fellow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew <Ilene> too, so I can 
understand his shock...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I think I'll go check
on him for a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I put <Igtenos> on 
top of this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. All you have to
do is activate the device on 
the control panel over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, would you mind going 
over to the control panel?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Oh, yes. Now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well. Let's get started.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>...
Please, come back to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, we're good here.
I'll take care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what justice is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh. I knew you would go there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, <Stahn>. Don't think 
too much about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're not very bright, are you?
You said so yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know what's 
going on with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So let me ask you, what 
are you fighting for?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's obvious, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a Swordian Master.
I felt I had to do it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're not the type of person who
is driven by a cause like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the type who works hard
for the people close to you, for 
someone important.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is... that so...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll change the question. What's the
ideal you're trying to achieve?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
"I want to make my family happy."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then that's fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's enough of a reason for
you to fight. There's no point in 
expanding your reach outside of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez...!
<Stahn>, look at me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not just for your family that 
you have to work hard, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be there for you.
Don't forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> and others are...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. <Philia>, <Woodrow>, <Mary>, 
<Chelsea>, and <Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And me, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need you to take care of yourself.
You have to protect us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right or wrong, just or not...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
More than that, what I need to do is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Protect my loved ones.
So that's what I'm going to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you finally convinced?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Rutee>.
I think I finally understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. That's good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I also realized how important 
you all are to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess I have to do it for
everyone like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's go back to your precious
friends. You're okay, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like it's over.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
How's it going...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>, can you hear me? If you 
can hear me, please answer me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can hear you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>, you're fixed!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You gave me a hard time in the 
earlier battle with <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry I haven't been 
more helpful to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though you couldn't speak, 
you heard us, didn't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Precisely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since you are back, what are 
we going to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The mirrored barrier that
surrounds Dycroft will be cut
through by the Swordians, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's just like <Ritora>...
That's a pretty reckless strategy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it is now our only option.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need your help. Will you
fight with me, <Igtenos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. I've been waiting
for this moment to come.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will fulfill my duties as a Swordian
Master and King of Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be with me until I die, and 
become my strength, <Igtenos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now I'm one of the masters, aren't I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Congratulations.
<Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the Swordian team. We've 
successfully repaired the <Igtenos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well done, everyone. We've just 
completed the neutralization device
here as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's also the delivery of the device.
I'd like you to return to Radisrol.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
