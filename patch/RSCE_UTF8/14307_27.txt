[ENDBLOCK]
Boy

And you're cocky for a girl!

What are you trying 
to be, a grown-up?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am a grown-up.
I'm not a child like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't look like a kid at all!
And adults don't wear pumpkin
pants like that.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I beg your pardon!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Because as you can see~.

What? Why are you such a child?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hey. Don't cry over
something like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>

No, I'm not crying! Because I'm
going to be wearing these pants
for the next 20 years!

Boo.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, don't get mad at
me all of a sudden.

They said there was a big thunderstorm
southwest of the city. Is that Belcrant?

I'd protect Phandaria.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
