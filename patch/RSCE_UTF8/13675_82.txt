[ENDBLOCK]
Me? I'm <Walt>'s Secretary...
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Why am I dressed like
this in such trying times.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
At Mr. <Walt>'s insistence,
I also helped him collect lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Finally, I feel like I've done a
job that is typical of a Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
At Mr. <Walt>'s insistence,
I also helped him collect lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry to hear that. By the
way, What can I do for you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever you want
a job, come to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry to hear that. By the
way, What can I do for you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever you want
a job, come to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
How's it going? You're
always welcome at my place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I got this from my own sources...
I heard that <Lion> is involved somehow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
The last time I saw him, he looked
like he was loyal to the royal family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I honestly didn't think <Lion>
would do something like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey brother. How's the
lens collecting going?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey brother. How's the
lens collecting going?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like the lens came
together without a hitch.
It was worth the effort.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you're Walt. Would you
like to see what I brought?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is certainly the treasure we
spoke of. Good job getting it out
of that temple.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well of course, who do you
think you're dealing with?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
... You're <Rutee> Katrea? I've heard
stories about you and of your... features.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know where you heard that
from, but I'm definitely <Rutee>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aha! You're that infamous
greedy witch <Rutee>!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Well then, I will agree to
take this treasure off your hands.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you really are as great as they
say, I would appreciate if you 
didnt stand there and bad mouth me.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of life have
you led up to now...?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone seems to know
you, that's so cool.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that we've established
who I am, let's talk business.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, of course. As for payment...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, right.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
10,000 gald.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got to be kidding me!
That's not the amount we agreed on!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know how to read. But for this
treasure, the market price is 
much higher.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can always give it to someone
else. Well, what'll it be?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well, things are getting
serious. Good thing I brought
along my personal bodyguard.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, hey there.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can look me in the eye without
backing down. You've got guts huh,
kid?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uuuuummmm...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Rutee>. Don't tell me...
are you extorting this guy?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you just figure that out?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way! It's not like I accepted
a commission from this guy!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I got the treasure on my own
and just came here, so this
is a legitimate discussion.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I get it! Then
there's no problem!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Don't do things that aren't right"
is one of the Aileron family mottos.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're pretty interesting, kid, I like
you. All right, I'll pay your price.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for your patronage.
I'm glad you speak my language.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
And now I have the treasure I've
wanted. Now let's celebrate
and eat!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You should all join me. We'll
share in our celebration.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh... I think we'll pass on that.
It's a bit too much trouble.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well, even though we have
prepared a huge spread of
delicious food.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Food...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huge Spread...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since he's said that, shouldn't
we just accept his offer?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, do you guys
share a brain now...?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, whatever. Just
for a bit, though.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right! it's decided.
You, lead the way.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
