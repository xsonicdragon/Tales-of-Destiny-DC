When she began to cry, it 
was like a wailing dragon.
Certainly a child full of energy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there a memory locked
away in this lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's thanks to <Hugo> that
you are able to live like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I, too, have come to find
<Hugo> to be dependable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's brilliant, yet he still
lacks a full understanding
of the world in his youth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
When it comes to Archeology,
you need money and you need
connections.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. Well, it's somewhat
pointless to talk to a baby
about this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope you grow up to be
big and strong, so you can
help me, Master <Hugo>,
and Lady Kris out at work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah come now, don't cry. Is it because
I'm only talking about my dreams, and
not your happiness?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That baby just now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There seems
to be a note that was
written a long time ago.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>The townspeople... 
I may be challenging the Goddess
with my blade pointed at her...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
WOW I WONDER WHATS
GONNA HAPPEN HERE?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
This...this has to be a joke...
the whole world..!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, what do you think?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I am simply here to deliver
President <Hugo>'s instructions.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Ilene>!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it!? I'm in the middle
of an important conversation!
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
But still! The townspeople
are quarraling again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Again!? Why?
Why can't they all just understand...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Ilene>...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll head that way once I'm done here.
Please make the necessary preparations.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Right away.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
The poor despise the wealthy...
the wealthy look down on the poor...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only everyone could
be happy together,
with the town safe..
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you think that the attack
just now has shown us something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that?

[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
A person's mind seems
complex, but to be honest
it's surprisingly simple.

[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems to me that the way you
do things is simply not enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
What..do you mean?

[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
When a powerful foreign enemy makes
it's appearance, do the people not unite
as one at that time?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
...

[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Consider this. Follow <Hugo>'s
orders first, and then see how
the people react.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
...But..supposing even then,
the townspeople don't change?

[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
At that point,
it will be up to you.

[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
You can either give up your ideals,
or you can give up everything...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand.

[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Then you accept,
I will inform President <Hugo> of this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
This brings you one step
closer to the answers you seek...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Say no more, please!

[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, excuse me.
I am being intrusive.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then,
I should get going.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I cannot,
I must not back down.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must push onward.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All of this...
all that happened... 
It's because of <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only that monster didn't exist,
then <Ilene> would have...!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even so, <Stahn>.
This was <Ilene> chosen path.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's... ridiculous!!
You've got it all, completely wrong!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Right, <Stahn>. It's good
to not understand it now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you were to understand it all, 
then <Ilene>'s last request woulda
been wasted...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
