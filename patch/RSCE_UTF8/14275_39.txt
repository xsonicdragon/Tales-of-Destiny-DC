You see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this about father?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Father lived in a very hot
place when he was a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And where is your father now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Father died in the last war.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fine. I'm actually happy to see
something looking for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Here, take this. As thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Speaking of which, father used to
say he wanted to be friends with
someone from Neuestadt.

[ENDBLOCK]
Are you travelers? Conduct
yourselves properly in this town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We only want what's best for this
country. Overthrowing the Royal
Family is not our goal.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Could you be...
Your Majesty... King <Woodrow>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
A declaration of war on the entire
surface...? Are they serious?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
That thing completely
cratered the surface...
Is that Belcrant's power?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this the end of humanity?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was instructed by captain
<Dalis> to collect the lenses...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty <Woodrow>,
please save humanity.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We will make Phandaria into a new
country with our own hands!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain <Dalis> has spoken to the
new king to make sure we are not
punished.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this Aeth'er War I hear
about? What's happening!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If a city were to be hit by Belcrant...
How many people would die!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't been able to rest lately...
I keep thinking Belcrant might
strike again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We will do what we can here.
Please, save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We were able to win the battle
because Lord <Greybum> was on our side.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
People were praising Lord <Greybum>
a little while ago, and now they're
all badmouthing him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, the grown-ups are just
putting all the blame on Lord <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky is looking weird.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky flashed and made a
loud sound out of nowhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
What will we do if the
whole sky is blocked?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The lenses in this city were
all sent to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
When did we start chumming
up to that town's people?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
If everybody joins forces together
we will definitely win.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
Come now, come come, come see!

[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that big crater opened up?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is it always dark outside now?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that if we collect a lot of
lenses something good will happen.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Has this town also fallen
into rebel hands...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be waiting outside for the time
being. I don't want to be found out
and cause a commotion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go with you.

Rebel Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
They don't look familiar.
Who are they?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhmmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that <Mary>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know me?
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying?
We fought together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I did? With you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought you died two years ago!
[ENDBLOCK]
I gotta let the captain know!
Wait here!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Did something happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain <Dalis>! Good, you're here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ma...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And you are?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Could it be!? You...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
They look alike, but that's not her.
[ENDBLOCK]
That can't be... after all...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are returning to Heidelberg.
You two, come with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
What...
[ENDBLOCK]
U-understood.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
As soon as you are done with
your business, leave. Get out of 
this country as soon as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you maybe an acquaintance
of <Mary>'s?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a second. You are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've warned you. Next
time I won't let it slide.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you remember something
about him <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know... I don't know but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>、are you okay!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My head is hurting a
little... but I'm fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
This place seems to be strongly
connected to her. It's stimulating
the part of her brain that controls
memory.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This city is...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, go call <Woodrow> and the
others. They can now enter the city
without drawing attention.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't <Mary>! When
did you come back?
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem to be in good health.
I thought you had died!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
U-...Umm...
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems good things keep happening.
First we win the battle, then Isaac died.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe this is also Lord <Greybum>'s
influence. He seems to bring good
luck wherever he goes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you say Lord <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you be going back
to your house <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My house...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>'s house? Where!?
[ENDBLOCK]
It's on the west side. The walls are green,
so you should notice it right away...
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I was in the middle of shopping.
Well then, I'll see you later.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
it seems people from the royal
family are not welcome in this city...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That way of talking... it's too harsh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Best not to mind it. I'm sure
<Greybum> deceived everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The story isn't that simple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What isn't?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This means that there are
people in this country who
are receptive to <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
This town might be
a rebel army base.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guys...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be that as it may, better not
to overstay. Let's leave as soon
as we are done ressuplying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before that... <Mary>, what do you
want to do? Want to try going to
your house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I want to. It might make
my memories resurface
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Certainly. Let's go guys. We gotta make
sure what that woman said is true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow> is with us. So it's better
not to do unnecessary things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is not unnecessary. 
It's important.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, we can't 
just leave it be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
... If it's unavoidable
then hurry up and go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>, is
something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My father was once celebrated
as a Philopher King.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why did that father have such an
unyielding attitude towards Cyril...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry... that is a question I'll
have to find an answer for myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I suppose I won't ascend the
throne until I have that answer.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
