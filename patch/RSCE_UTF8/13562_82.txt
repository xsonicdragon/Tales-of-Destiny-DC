[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Slowly pulsing beneath the floor
are the remnants of what
was once a living thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We managed to escape...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear <Woodrow>, something is wrong 
with the ocean! Something's coming up?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What... the hell is that thing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dycroft...!
It's actually back...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell is a Dycroft?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is an aerial city that was
once used in the Aeth'er Wars.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aeth'er Wars...? Aerial city...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
There are energy reactions all
over the world. Perhaps it's 
other airborne cities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't think they'd all come
back at once. I guess I was 
completely conspired against.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that <Hugo>'s goal was
to revive the aerial city.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni is also the power
source for these aerial cities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what <Hugo> was talking
about. So that's the essence
of the divine eye!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now we know why <Greybum> has
been touring the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was preparing to use the 
Eye of Atamoni to revive the
aerial cities around the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
In hindsight, it 
all makes sense. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that? The Aerial city?
The bottom is glowing...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's Belcrant!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh no... There's a big
hole in the Earth!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, my god...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>, what are
you planning?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be ridiculous...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is bullshit! This is 
the Aeth'er Wars! What's 
the City in the Air?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because of that crap, That
<Lion> is...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, what are you doing!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think!? We're going
to avenge <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>...! Because of 
people like you!...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't allow it! I'll
never forgive you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Calm Down <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
