Hey! You're just in time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a bad feeling about 
this, young master...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Same.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, I'm busy.
Now then, if you'll excu-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, don't be like that!
There's nothing to fear!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, over here, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What even is this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If this works, your body will
undergo an incredible transformation!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, hope you're ready!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here we go!! POWER ON!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
GAHHH!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okaay...annd...stop!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah...Hah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you okay?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Somehow, yeah.
What about you, Chal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Reynolds>,
just what was tha-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*Hic!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you...hiccupping??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-yeah, seems like it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*Hic! Hiccup!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woohoo! Success!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What do you me-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HIC!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This time, I've invented a machine
that gives you the hiccups!
I call it the "Hicculationalizer"!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
When someone's exposed to that light,
they can't stop hiccupping!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think?
I'm a genius, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'd better be able to
fix this, <Reynolds>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HICCUP!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't tell me you already
want to go back to
how you were!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lemme at least get some data
first! I wanna see how long it lasts...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've gotta be ki-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HUP*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have better f-fix this
now or I-I'll...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HURK*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh fine! Put the sword away.
I'm sure I can fix you right up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurry up alrea-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HIKK*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright. POWER ON!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, time to make some notes.
As expected, even the
mighty Hedge Knight...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...is absolutely adorable...
...when he's got the hiccups...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...! Try saying that aga-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HIC*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looking forward to working with
you on my next experiment, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph! No one in their right
mind would willingly do so!!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
