<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I'm counting on you to 
investigate the Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must head to the Straylize
Temple as soon as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must do whatever it takes 
to regain the Eye of Atamoni.
I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for your efforts.
I'll see you upon your return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I'm counting on you to 
investigate the Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must head to the Straylize
Temple as soon as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must do whatever it takes 
to regain the Eye of Atamoni.
I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Getting the Eye of Atamoni back is 
our first priority. Don't forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>... have you been 
deceiving me all this time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian Masters, save Cresta.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, I know you are tired,
but please go see <Reynolds>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our country will do everything in 
our power to support your actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've arranged for you to stay at an
inn in town. I hope you get some rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've done all we can do.
It's up to you now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must not, by any chance, fail
to meet His Majesty's expectations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cresta is a city east 
of the royal capital.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you reach the city, look
for our resident soldiers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must not, by any chance, fail
to meet His Majesty's expectations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only the Seven Generals
had been in the castle, this
would not have happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that I think about it, the 
dispersal of the Seven Generals
was also part of <Hugo>'s plan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of <Hugo>, I regretfully made
myself an enemy of my country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll send military help immediately.
I need you to hold out until then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> wants to talk to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The entrance to the laboratory is 
in the courtyard of the castle.
Be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are sending out directives to 
every city in the country and 
collecting lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm very sorry for pushing you 
to do one thing after another.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The operation is scheduled to take
place tomorrow morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe you will be victorious, 
Swordian masters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the audience room.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Now everyone, hurry
to the courtyard.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Please proceed to His
Majesty's throne.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
The ship I arranged for you will
be docked at Darilsheid port.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, how fancy! Is this
the Seinegald castle?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're pretty happy-go-lucky,
aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are in the presence of His
Majesty The King! All of you,
show some respect!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah~! <Atwight>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dymlos, are you
all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know why you've
been brought here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, give <Atwight>
back! She's mine!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Silence!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The fact you attempted to ravage ruins
under the King's control, and that you
caused a fight over in town,
is inexcusable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have prepared a punishment
severe enough for your crime!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You, over there!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That Sword... <Dymlos> was under
the escort of one of our ships.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, why did you have
it in your possesion?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... Well, a bunch of things
happened, and...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't play dumb with me.
That tactic is useless here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard quite a few rumors
regarding the disappearance
of the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is bad. At this rate, we're
definitely gonna get convicted!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? That'd be a problem!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait.
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
These people, though imperfect,
wield the Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
They possess unique abilities. Aren't
you being a bit hasty in condemning
them so abruptly?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...<Hugo>, What are you thinking?)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
But if their punishment is an
easy one, then we won't be able
to make an example of them!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Please permit me to speak!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Some unknown personnel have
attacked Straylize Temple!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Straylize Temple?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What should we do, Your Highness?
This comes as quite a surprise...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there something about Straylize
Temple that worries you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
In truth, there is an extremely
important relic being hidden
in that temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
These people must be after it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
This relic, could it possibly
be the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are <Dymlos> and <Atwight>
so surprised about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who knows?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hugo... so you knew about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was originally involved in
archaeology, so I can surmise
what it might be, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just how important is this
Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is said that it's the source
of the great calamity that befell
the world long ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've been left with this warning: 
"The Eye of Atamoni must never see
the light of day again."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, then let's
dispatch a team immediately, 
under my command.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait. You may be the General, 
but if you thoughtlessly dispatch
the army, it will cause a panic 
among our citizens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then what do you
propose we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should at least confer with
the other Seven Generals, but right
now they're all in the middle
of other missions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehh... Are there no qualified
people available?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... well, what if
you let me go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...Is this smart?)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If there's no one else that can
do it, then please let me go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to become a knight of
Seinegald and do great things,
at any cost.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You insolent boy!
Silence, now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where do you get off, speaking
to a government official like
that? Know your place!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. It might not be
a completely bad idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I'm not mistaken, the Swordians
were created in the same era as
the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since they're all relics from
ancient times, their abilities may
prove useful to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying we should let
these criminals run loose?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wouldn't it be enough to put them
under <Lion>'s supervision? Since
he also uses a Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...I see...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's your
plan, <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's what you're saying, then it's
plausible. Your son has accomplished
a great many things all on his own, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's certainly as you say. But
there probably isn't another
candidate for this, anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That <Hugo> guy is
<Lion>'s dad, then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
At the least, it would give us
the ability to keep tabs on
these three.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
It should be fine if he wears the
device that <Reynolds> invented
the other day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. Since this is a state
of emergency, we'll go with
Hugo's plan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> Magnus!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You will go to the temple, and
bring these people along.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If by some possibility something
has happened to the Eye of Atamoni,
use your full power to secure it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary> and I got pulled into
this before we knew it..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll do my best! I look forward
to working with you as a knight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, Swordian Masters, for
taking the time to gather here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry for this blunder.
Really, I can't even begin to apologize.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
First of all, please let us know 
the details of the situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who used a Draconis to steal 
the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> Magnus.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion> is what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why he says he's the one
who took the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Such nonsense.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no way <Lion> would 
do something like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Unfortunately, what 
<Dryden> says is true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, <Lion> took the 
Draconis that was in the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shortly thereafter, we received a 
report that the Eye of Atamoni had 
been stolen. No doubt about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was <Chaltier> doing? 
There was no way he could just
sit back and let it happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like I'm being subjected 
to one hell of a nightmare.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
At the same time, <Hugo>, Oberon's
general manager, also disappeared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We believe the two of them to 
be colluding, with one another.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does that mean Oberon will be 
involved? This is getting weird.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any idea where 
the Draconis was headed?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
While we waited for you to 
assemble, we conducted a 
survey with our full force.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a result, we had a rough 
idea of where to look. It was a
small island northeast of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The island was once home 
to an Oberon factory.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even after they shut it down, 
the facility still remained. There's a
good chance they're hiding in there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you know that, why don't 
you just punch it in?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we make a big deal out of it, 
they might notice. We can't afford
to let them get away with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
And that's where we come in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. I'd like to ask you all to
infiltrate the Oberon factory.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you find the Eye of 
Atamoni, I want you to 
retrieve it at all costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
As far as <Lion> Magnus is concerned.
You decide what to do at that time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's best to capture him, but if it's
too difficult, ...he can live or die.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That means we may 
have to fight <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand that this is 
difficult for you as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
But as long as the matter involves
the Eye of Atamoni, it is unavoidable. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I don't like it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> is our dearest friend.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've been through a lot. 
We retrived the Eye of Atamoni
from <Greybum> together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no way that <Lion> would 
do the same thing as <Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to assume that <Lion> 
is the bad guy and act accordingly!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're too naive! This is no
time for sentimentality!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not done talking. 
Shut up and listen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure <Lion> has 
some plan for this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So I'm heading to the Oberon
factory to find out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Getting the Eye of Atamoni back is 
our first priority. Don't forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our ships will take you to the island
where the factory is located.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a ship at the harbor, please 
board it along with the soldiers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have done a great deed,
reclaiming the Eye of Atamoni!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Furthermore, I would like to
thank His Highness, <Woodrow>,
for the direct conveyance of the 
Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's put together a policy on 
how to store the Eye of Atamoni
as soon as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. With the combined efforts of
our two countries, we should be able
to set up a complete security system.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are happy to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> Magnus.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've completed your mission,
while also looking after these criminals. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is unfortunate that one was lost.
However, you've done a wonderful job.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, your Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Next up. <Stahn> Aileron
and <Rutee> Katrea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your work was also excellent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
In light of the safe return of
the Draconis, the two of you 
are free to go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, <Stahn> Aileron. About your
request to be a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I've actually
changed my mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure about this, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've learned a lot through this trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I met a lot of people. I saw a lot of
things and thought about a lot.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But I still have a lot to learn.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to see more of the world
and meet more people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you can't do that 
if you're a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm really sorry. But I wanted to 
pursue that experience first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
For that reason. It's not time 
for me to be a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...So then, what will you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will return to my hometown.
Then I'll think about what to do next.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand. I'll take care 
of the matter. You can come 
back when you feel like it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
My kingdom will be waiting for
you with an empty seat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, you will return
<Dymlos> to me. My kingdom
has ownership of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you return, we will hand
him back to you. Understand?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry for being so
selfish. Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, ..,then, King <Woodrow>, 
I would like to begin our 
discussion immediately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Certainly. Let's begin by
asking the Swordians
for their opionions on this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Forgive the intrusion,
Your Highness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, Sir <Lion>. What became
of the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Regarding that, I apologize that
I have an urgent request
to ask of you, Your Highness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. Go on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will get to the point.
The Eye of Atamoni was stolen
away from a room within the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!? Curse that <Hugo>!
Such is the result
of my listening to him!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
As I feared. Regardless of
how talented you are, it was foolish
of me to leave this to a mere child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
..<Dryden>! Call for
General <Dryden> at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Lion>, your part in this
is complete. You are dismissed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, hear what
I have to say!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no time to listen
to your excuses. We must
act without delay!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Highness, I will not make
excuses. However, I
also refuse to give up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The true culprit was
the High Priest, <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He is currently heading
for Calvalese, and with him,
the Eye of Atamoni, itself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Calvalese..!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Furthermore, I have in my
custody an eyewitness,
one who saw <Greybum> in the act.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Were you to allow me
use of a ship, your Highness,
I vow that I would return
the Eye of Atamoni, without fail!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...In that case, very well.
I will have a ship prepared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, it will require some time
to arrange this. I trust
that this will not be an issue?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. I swear that your Majesty
will not regret this decision.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>, you did it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems so..
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, I must ask you something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, your Highness?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell me. Does
<Hugo> know of this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Why do you ask, if I may?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am the one
asking. Answer me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes. He is aware.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
That puts me at ease.
However, why is <Hugo> not with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's rather irresponsible
of him to leave this to you, alone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's..awful!
Just because Master <Lion>
is alone, that doesn't mean-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal, hush..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty! I would ask
that you not judge my character
behind my back!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(<Hugo>...!)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, President <Hugo>.
For what reason were
you hiding yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is my duty as <Lion>'s father
to look after him,
even during his failures.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because he has already informed
me of the situation, I have
already begun preparing a ship
to depart immediately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oho, that's just like you, <Hugo>
You've left no detail
out at all, have you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Lion>. Like I said,
It would take time for me
to prepare a boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be thankful for your loving father.
Now, go! Pursue that which stole
the Eye of Atamoni from us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes, your Highness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The moment the ship is ready,
I will immediately depart.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> Magnus, reporting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmh.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Today, your mission is to escort
a bishop from Harmentz Village
over to Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since the <Greybum> incident, the
temple has remained short-handed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, you must escort him
to the temple before nightfall.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
To you, this may seem a simple task.
However, understand that it is
still of the utmost importance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care, and return safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, your Highness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've already told you, but
I am sending two of my
soldiers along with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
I am Will. I'm honored to be
working with you, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Jobs. You should
at least say hello.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you. You're younger than me.
Is this really gonna be OK?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs...that's why they 
say you'll never be a captain...
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Please excuse him, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not a sycophant like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm not as shallow as you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell, man?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be silent, you two! You are
in the presence of the King!
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
...As I explained to you two earlier,
I will be promoting one of you to captain.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
As for which one, Sir <Lion>
will be the judge of that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's my decision?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We had a difference
of opinion as to which of
these two should be promoted.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, we decided that
you could be trusted to
make that decision.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the agreement we reached.
Will you take care of it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case,
then I accept.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please forgive us for 
burdening our Hedge Knight's
shoulders with this matter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once your duty is completed,
we will expect you to nominate
one of these men for promotion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
That will be no issue.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs. Will.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
This mission will determine which 
of you two will be promoted to Captain.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dedicate all of your mind,
body, and soul into the 
completion of your task!
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir! Leave it to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Roger that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, the mission was
completed without incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. Well done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Bishop is an indispensable figure in
the reconstruction of Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take pride knowing that you have
assisted in laying such a foundation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell us, <Lion>. How did 
it go with those two?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir. Here is my
report on them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll start by talking about
each one's personalities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs puts others before himself.
He focuses on the well-being of
his friends and whoever he's guarding.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
In my opinion, these qualities
make for a good leader.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will, on the other hand, always
puts the mission first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He knows what is expected of him,
as well as what it takes
to complete the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This, too, is essential
for any good leader.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. It sounds like we are on 
the same page. Still, Sir <Lion>, I 
want to hear your opinion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs or Will?
Which one is more qualified 
to be Captain?
[ENDBLOCK]
select
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs deserves to be Captain
Will deserves to be Captain

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, if you'll excuse me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be counting on you
next time, too, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that Jobs is the right
choice for promotion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, explain your
reason for choosing him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
At first glance, choosing one's
fellow man over their duty seems
counterproductive for a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true. Job's focus
on the well-being of his companions
is what brings about success.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I learned something when the
<Greybum> Incident took
me around the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You cannot overcome everything alone.
It's important to have reliable companions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The more powerful the foe,
the more important it becomes
to have friends you can trust.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that having more men like
Jobs in the army will have
the greatest benifit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is just my opinion,
but if I were with Jobs,
I would know he had my back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm...I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well, Sir <Lion>. Per your
reccomendation. Jobs will
be promoted to Captain.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you really sure about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have an issue with my choice?
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it ain't that, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about Will. I'm sure
he'll make Captain, someday, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, OK. Thank you. I'll
be aimin' to be like you, you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph...
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, I'm glad to know
you agreed with me, y'know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain Jobs. Your first assignment
has already been decided.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'll be a tough one, but
I'm sure you're up to the task.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Yessir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that Will is the right
choice for promotion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, explain your
reason for choosing him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
While escorting the Bishop through
the forest, we were ambushed by a monster.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before I knew it, I found myself
facing it down alone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Despite this, he made the right
call to withdraw, knowing that fighting
would put the Bishop, and the mission, at risk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This was surely not an
easy decision to make.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
One's emotions can easily get the
better of them, clouding their judgement.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will, however, kept his cool.
He acted rationally, even
in the heat of the moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was Will's actions that ultimately
lead to the completion of the mission.
For this, I am proud of him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm...I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well, Sir <Lion>. Per your
reccomendation. Jobs will
be promoted to Captain.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Was I really the right choice...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have a problem
with my decision?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
No, not at all, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about Jobs. He'll make
a great captain some day, I'm sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right...
Thank you very much, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
I will continue to devote myself 
to becoming more like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, then, Captain Will. Your first
assignment has already been decided.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not going to be an easy one,
but I'm sure you're up to the task.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> Magnus,
reporting for duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for coming, and for your
expert handling of your previous duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are too kind, my liege.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, I shall brief
you on your next mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Early this morning, we received
an urgent report from the 
soldiers stationed at Cresta.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
It stated that an unusual monster
had been sighted in the area.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I would like
you to investigate this sighting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it a particularly
dangerous monster?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is, as of now, unknown.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Unknown? Is that true?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
To be honest, the report we
received was quite vague,
and difficult to interpret.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fortunately, it doesn't seem
that Cresta has been attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, we do require 
more specific information 
before we can act.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Then I should consider 
this to be a scouting mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. I do understand
this may be beneath you, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, your Majesty, not at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Due to the nature of the mission,
I won't be able to send any
soldiers with you, this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, if this monster does
show itself, you are under 
no obligation to engage.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That won't be a problem.
I'm not alone, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have <Chaltier>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
At any rate, it is imperative that
we understand what is truly going on.
It is requested that you depart at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
Leave it to me.

[ENDBLOCK]
It's been months since we've 
all been together like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Leen
[ENDBLOCK]
So, Your Majesty? What was it
you wanted this time?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lewein
[ENDBLOCK]
Leen, how dare you speak to 
His Majesty in such a way?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha. Don't worry about it.
Leen, you haven't changed a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty. I'm not sure you 
should spoil <Leen> like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Leen
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Melina>. You're really good
at speaking your mind with His 
Majesty, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stupid!	It's not like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, come on, let's not do this.
I'm sure <Leen> likes <Melina>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why I'm hanging on 
to you like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't say that. 
The idea of being loved by
this guy is horrifying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
But the women of the 
world want to be loved 
by this guy, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Leen
[ENDBLOCK]
Well said, <Ascus>.
Great job!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is in front of you, Your
Majesties. Can't you stop them?

why did you call us together?

Lewein
[ENDBLOCK]
No, not like that.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Leen>!
Come on, say something, <Ascus>.

on my hands, either.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha-ha-ha! That's right. I should
consider your position as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I will call you all again when 
you are not in a hurry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
To His Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, you're dismissed.

I knew it was for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Somebody! Get the <Queen> 
and <Ashley> down here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm here now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm, sorry to call you down.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The reason I asked you to come 
here is no other reason.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Queen> and I have been 
talking about this for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to get straight to the point.
Will you become our heir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
My husband and I do not have
any children. Therefore...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure about that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, because that's what 
I originally told <Finlay>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're <Finlay>'s little 
brother, you're perfect.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S12>(...Another brother.)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you say something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think, <Ashley>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S12>(...I'm not a substitute.)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, let's hear your answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I'm afraid
I must decline your offer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that, <Ashley>?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please excuse...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought the world would
turn out like this. If only his brother
were here. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was hoping to see the fire in 
his cold, strong will.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>, who are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, he's a friend of 
my brother's, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> was an unpleasant man, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had high hopes for <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
But now, he's dead!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I always thought that 
<Dryden> hated <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought that when he was a 
little older, that would be when
I would retire.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We had planned to have <Lion> 
serve as the new Seventh General.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> was!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. But that's all a dream now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was hoping to see the fire in 
his cold, strong will.<x00>
