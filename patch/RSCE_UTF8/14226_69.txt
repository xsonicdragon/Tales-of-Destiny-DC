<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!

why men climb mountains?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't women climb them, too?
[ENDBLOCK]

It's because the mountain is in
front of them! That's why, right?!

Gahahah! You got that right,
<Stahn>! I'm the Champion, after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha, even so, <Stahn>'s
is so small and cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well well, what about <Woodrow>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
WOAHH it's HUUUUGE!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-How could I have lost...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen one so
big in my entire life!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, that was refreshing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps I should invite
<Darzen> next time...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
Why is everyone staring at me like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You look like <Kongman>

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, n-nope nothing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's nothing at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with them

[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who knows?<x00>
