[ENDBLOCK]
Hi, it's been a long time!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken 
me for someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't go away. Come on,
let's talk about it again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you really a different person?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, sorry about that.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
As you've realized your mistake.
Don't worry about it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that much like
the person you had met before?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If one of his acquaintances sees
you...that would be an interesting
reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
He seemed to be in a rush, so it 
will be impossible to find him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Then you should find 
somebody who might know him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'll mistake 
you for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Wasn't that big hairy guy
with you the other day?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time you see him,
give this to that man.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, did you stop braiding?
It was looking good on you.

Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm grateful to you,
my brave friend,
for serving as my guide.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that my grandson was
interested in swordsmanship.
I can only hope for the best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm grateful that the brave
man acted as a guide.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
My grandson will be successful. 
He learned swordsmanship from 
a brave man..
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's so noisy these days. 
I have my grandson practicing
swordsmanship.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm grateful that the brave
man acted as a guide.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
My grandson will be successful. 
I learned swordsmanship from 
a brave man.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
What will happen 
to the village?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope the heroes would help
me when I was in a dangerous
situation with my back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
We will give you our lens. 
Please help us, for the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I want my son to study
more than just swordsmanship
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
That "Self-Proclaimed" trio
of heroes are obvious con artists.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Even so, both the village chief
and his son are wrapped around
their little finger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
If he does learn anything, I can't
say that it's swordsmanship or study.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
That "self-proclaimed" heroic trio
was really trying to escape, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
It's safe to say that soldiers
will come from the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew that those three 
"self-proclaimed" heroes 
were not enough for us....

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
