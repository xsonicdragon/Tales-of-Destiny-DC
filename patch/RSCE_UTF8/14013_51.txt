Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? I believe you are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. You're the one that 
defeated <Lilith> in the arena?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
And there it is!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Don't talk to 
me like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it? Eh, uh~...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay to talk about <Lilith>,
you can talk about her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the one. I thought I'd
give you some good information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Didn't we once have a pirate
invasion of this city?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you mean <Batista>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
One of them is a sunken pirate ship.
in this area of the ocean.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's also possible that some
treasure had sunk with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you don't want to share
such valuable information with me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's at the bottom of the sea,
anyway. I'll never get there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Lilith>, say thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish I was stronger.
I can't do it, can I?
[ENDBLOCK]
Armor Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
I carry some fine arms.
Have a look around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Armor Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
You have no idea what's going to
happen at a time like this. You
should be well prepared.

Meat merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Fitzgald meat is delicious!
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sure how long this city will
survive, but I'll continue to do
business until the end!
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
How about some
fresh picked fruit?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
We still have stock,
feel free to shop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome.
Make a purchase!
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that the sun is gone, I'm
worried about our crop production.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
If you hang around here long
enough, you can get leftovers.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I take what I can get here and
eat it with my family back home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm hungry...
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a strange ship get into the harbor
and put some kinda priest on board.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, I haven't been
eating the leftovers.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, please! Bring back
the light of day!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
The city's opinion of
Oberon is controversial.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a long-time resident, but I think 
it's good for the city to develop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I think that Ms. <Ilene> is fine with
evacuating the residents without
taking their own risks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Has <Ilene> gotten over this city?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald has sent a large number
of soldiers to the damaged area.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
But the government of this country
doesn't do anything in this situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
The government doesn't do anything,
even though we don't know when the
city will be attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Rather than waiting for the powers
that be, I was thinking of doing
what I could.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't much, But I
gave what lens I could.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know why that barbarian
<Kongman> or whatever, is so popular.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> took out a fleet of armed
ships? Hmmm, can't get it out of my head.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, are you going somewhere?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Where's <Kongman> going to go?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> is the hero of this city,
right? Then protect this city!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, I was wrong. I'm sorry
for being so selfish.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck in your quest to save
the world. Mighty! Mighty! Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Go for it! <Kongman>！
Mighty! Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
People who are satisfied with material
things are not necessarily mentally
satisfied as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
What this city needs most right now,
is a Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish we had a temple in this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
It is at times like this that we
should spread the teachings of
Atamoni to the people of the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this another test
that Atamoni has given us...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni will surely be a guide
on your path ahead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
We are preparing for the next
sailing. Please wait for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter what happens, we won't
cancel the flight. I'll show you what
a sailor is capable of.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
How about some
freshly caught fish?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll sell fish
no matter what!

Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have the Battle Record book?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem reliable enough. 
Here, take this with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]

coordination that is effective 
against the monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]

by setting [Definite Strike] to 
"ON" from the Customize menu
in the Main menu.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can also view each monster's
Definite Strike in the Monster Book
if Definite Strike is [ON].
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to give anymore. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to say to you now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back once you have honed
your skills some more.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice

[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! <Kongman>. Help me, please!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
More than ever, 
arguments are breaking out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of arguments exactly?
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
Sheesh, and this place is called
the best city on this continent?
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
It's to be expected. You have to
escape to anywhere that's safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, see? More and more people
from Seinegald have been showing up.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
At this rate, the town will be so full of
people, we'll be packed like sardines
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
On top of that, all they do is complain
and make noise...I'm utterly sick of it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you!
Stop whining!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! This town's full enough as it is,
go back to your own country!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
What a barbarous race of
people! It makes me sick!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case,
you might as well leave!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
f you think that, then maybe
you should leave too!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT! It's because of people like
you that this city will never advance!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
HEY! Cut it out, all of you! 
What's come over you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You stay out of this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everybody, calm down! What
would <Ilene> think of this??
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Didn't <Ilene> flee long ago? 
She was all talk, nothing more
than an idealist.
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You're wrong.
She was completely deluded.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did you say?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, cut it out.
What'll we do if you lose your cool?
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't kid around. Whatever <Ilene>
claimed to do for this city, there's
nothing to show for it at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thats...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true at all!
Miss <Ilene> taught us a lot!

only care about themselves!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
But we're different.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Some way or another,
we will find a way to change this city!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, everyone! Are you
really going to let the kids leave
you in the dust like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I reckon we can't
say they're wrong!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It's..definitely pathetic to be
called out like this by kids..
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. That's right!
We should all work to make
this town the best it can be!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>... Looks like you've pulled
ahead of me in our little wager.
