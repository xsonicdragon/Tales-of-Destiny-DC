[ENDBLOCK]
I am known as the
Wandering Quiz Boy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Won't you try to answer
my trivia questions?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, that sounds fun but
I'm not very good at trivia.
How about you, <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm pretty confident, so
I'd like to take the quiz.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd say I'm not bad, myself.
Please go ahead with the question.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll take it? Well in
that case, here we go!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Question!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, sorry! When I say "Question!",
that means that I'm about to give
you the question.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Those participating should
say "Ready!" when I do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the first time I've
heard something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't overthink it. Consider it
an official way to start the quiz.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
OK, let's try again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Question!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ready!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ready!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The first King of Seinegald, known as
Ravell. Has achieved much, during his
reign, causing the people to remember
him in legend as the "King of _____".
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I would ask you
to fill in that blank!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. I have no clue!
How about you, <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My answer is this: 
"The King of Fresh Blood".
That's right, isn't it, <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No no no, My answer is
"The King of Happiness".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! Two totally different answers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
"The King of Happiness"? This is
the first time I've heard that one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Likewise, I've never heard him be
called "The King of Fresh Blood".
Are we thinking of a different
King entirely?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I'm very sure we're not...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You're both correct!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep! Radell is known as both 
"The king of Happiness" as well 
as "The King of Fresh Blood".
As well as...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
"The King of High Walls",
"The King of the People",
"The King of Crossed Spears",
and also "The King of Executions"
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
He has many different names!
Do you know why?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a tough one... I see that
each title carries a completely
different impression.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right... but there
has to be a reason...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Couldn't it be that different people
had different names for him?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Different people...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes! You're on the right track!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'see, each country actually has 
their own name for King Radell.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria calls him "The King of Fresh Blood", 
Seinegald knows him as "The King of Happiness".
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Calvalese calls him "The King of Crossed Spears", 
and long ago, the old ruined country called him
"The King of Executions".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... if he has so many different names,
it's not that much of a quiz, is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to agree.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you certainly have a point,
it's kind of a trick question, I guess.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I wanted you to realise
that regardless of how much you know,
yours is still only a single interpretation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Interpretation...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Basically, what you know
is only what you've seen
from your own perspective.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I don't get it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, my work here
is done. I should be off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I am searching for someone in particular.
That person has lived far longer than any
of us, beyond what we can imagine...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
...and also with the power
to soar out of our reality
as we know it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish to defeat that person,
and so I continue to wander.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp, I'm off! Bye bye!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was unexpected, but I feel like
I've learned something from this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, we should form a group
where we quiz one another, a
"Quiz Study Club"! How about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm, That could be interesting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's a great idea!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
T-This is different!
I-I'm not in love with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-You're completely wrong!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, what are you
two doing alone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Chelsea>,
don't intrude on the couple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-Wow, we look... like a couple?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you embarrassed about, <Melina>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
D-Don't be silly. I'm not embarrassed.
There's no way we're a couple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're not?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're not?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>, what are you saying!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, we shouldn't say that
in front of these children.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on <Chelsea>,
Let's get going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Boo. It was just about to
get to the good part.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Umm, <Ascus>.
I want to hear the rest of what
you were going to say...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well well, I came because I was
worried about you two, but it
seems my concern was unnecessary.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't wait... for this world
to return back to normal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...Only now you're acting like a woman...)
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, but this might be too
difficult for you. I seek those
who possess great knowledge.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Those who carry the title of trivia
royalty possess confidence in their
ability. Now, can you answer this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you wish to challenge me?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
That is most unfortunate.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
There's more to come.
Here we go!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
It would seem your title
was not just for show.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Not bad, but the true
battle begins here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
This is a surprise.

[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, let us begin!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
As I thought.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected!
Now then, how about this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-You've been rather diligent.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright... how about my trump card!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Not done yet!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
...How about this question!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible... I never imagined the time
would ever come to use this question.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, but see if you know this!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Rgh... I will not lose!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Rgh...
However, I still have this question!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Is your title just a decoration?
[ENDBLOCK]
Here are the numbers.

[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Your title is weeping.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought you might enjoy that...
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
This is where it all starts.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
Do you surrender?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
A good attempt, I suppose.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Good work.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
How did you like those?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
...You are skilled.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
You worked quite hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't take it too hard.
There's no way you could
have answered those.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
I had many more
questions prepared...
...What a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
That was rough...
[ENDBLOCK]
Kratos
[ENDBLOCK]
