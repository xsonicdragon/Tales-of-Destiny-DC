[ENDBLOCK]
Do you want to rest?
Yes
No

Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, by the way, <Lilith> is gone.
Where did she go?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
When I told my granddaughter 
about the legendary carrot, she
ran out of the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I think he's still near the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
The legendary carrots are 
said to be in the forest far
to the south of this village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that some monsters 
are guarding carrots.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

said to be in the forest far

[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that some monsters 
are guarding carrots.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of <Lilith> for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I used to be a soldier of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure my grandchildren 
are in the midst of working 
on that dream right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If we meet somewhere else, 
please let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
This is your home. Make yourself
at home as much as you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope you will all feel at home here
and relax as much as you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Follow the path you believe in,
<Stahn>. That is the way of life 
for a man of House Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
From my point of view, <Stahn>
is still a child. Thank you very 
much for your cooperation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you have your work cut
out for you. You can't just sit 
here and dawdle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith> and <Stahn>, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are tired, please 
come back anytime.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, you've got a good look.
You'll be fine then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah... You're the one
from back then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you come to see me, by chance?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, I gave up looking 
for the legendary carrot.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, I don't want you to come
into mine and my brother's room
without permission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, big brother!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet you're hungry. Do you want 
me to make you something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you hungry, also?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of the shopping 
for dinner, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't understand if you forget 
your promise, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of my brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to worry about 
me or grandpa, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of my brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
When it's all over and you come 
back, I'll make you a feast.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
To tell you the truth, I want my 
brother to come home soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wake up, brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
uhhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You better wake up soon.
Your breakfast will get cold.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
uhhzzzmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guuhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you want me to use that 
technique so badly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I have no choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ladle in my right hand!	Frying 
pan in my left hand! Let justice 
be done to those who lie in wait!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Roar! House Aileron Secret Technique!
 "Wake the Dead"!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Lilith>. Good morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's so hard to get you 
up in the morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry for you having to wake me.
Keep up the good work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, okay.
Leave it to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, come quickly.
Grandpa's hungry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm off to work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm coming with you. If there's 
anything I can do to help, just 
let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be fine today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to your help, I've been 
able to get a lot done lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, ...that's a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that you're back from your 
travels, you seem to have a lot 
of energy left, don't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think so, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, home is the best 
place to be, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah... well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
With that vague reply.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother ...maybe you 
want to go on another trip 
or something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm? Did you just say something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nevermind!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't just sit there, if you don't
have anything better to do, you can
help out around the house!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, yeah. What do you want me to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright. Go do some shopping.
Get something to eat for dinner.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I got it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
His response worries me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother! Where'd 
you go shopping!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no!
I'm sorry!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here it is.
Bargain beef.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh. You've bought something 
decent for a change, haven't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, <Bacchus> gave 
it to me. Out of the blue.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hello, little <Lilith>.
Did you get my present?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hello, little <Lilith>.
Did you get my present?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bargain beef from my heart.
Think of me when you eat it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now... what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care if you emphasize
the bargain part.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here it is. It's extra-fine beef!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way.	How could you afford that?
I thought you didn't have any money.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, I got it. You know, 
from the village chief's place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know she likes you, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't it weird to get beef from her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, it is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why I'm here.
Thanks for the help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm? What's with the red face?
What's wrong with your stomach?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell!	That means you've 
been blessed with beef after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What if they get the wrong idea 
that we're in trouble?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you really care?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I do!	I'm too embarrassed
to walk out the front door again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you're worrying 
about it too much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just go ahead and give it back to me!
Come on, come on! Come on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have to return it to me.
If you don't, I won't let you in 
the house!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wake up, big brother.
You have a visitor!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
hmzzz...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, it's hard to 
wake my brother up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait a moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ladle in my right hand!	Frying 
pan in my left hand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, get up! What are you 
doing lazily sleeping in the middle
of all this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
OMG! Get Up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought I heard <Dymlos>'s 
voice just now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it can't be, can it?
It must be just a dream, yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Long time no see, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>... are you a dream too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're still not awake. Why don't 
you go to the living room?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
The secret technique, 
"Wake the Dead"!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while, <Philia>.
And <Dymlos> and <Clemente>, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so glad you came all the 
way out here to see me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This isn't the time for greetings.
Something terrible has happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, the Eye of Atamoni 
has gone missing again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, my God!	The Eye of Atamoni!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to yell.
Will you please calm yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean, I thought they built a 
facility to keep it sealed off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that the Draconis suddenly
attacked and destroyed the facility.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
So they just took the Eye 
of Atamoni with them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Draconis is from 
Seinegald, right?
Why is that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There are other suspicious 
things as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean the location of the Eye of 
Atamoni seal must have been known
by only a few people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
This time, it was probably the 
work of someone from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The <King>, His Majesty has decided
to summon the Swordian Masters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was supposed to pick 
you up, so here I am.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, all right!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going with the others.
I can't just leave it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew you would say so.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just give me a minute, will you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going away again!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>... the thing is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
We had a deal. You promised 
you would never leave me again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I told you before how
worried I was when you
left before?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, you're going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't care about 
me or Grandpa.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true! <Lilith> and Grandpa
are both very important to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But this time it's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We desperately need 
your brother's help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That has nothing to do with me!
Do what you want!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...big brother, you're an idiot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh...
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
You've made a big mess.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa, I...
[ENDBLOCK]
You may go, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
You're in a lot of trouble, 
aren't you? I can see it in 
your eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Go ahead. And accomplish 
what only you can do.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take care of <Lilith>.
Don't worry, it's nothing 
to worry about.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, Grandpa.
It made me feel better to 
hear you say that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll talk to <Lilith> 
myself as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice to see you again, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
From now on, I'm going to be 
tougher on you than ever. Be 
prepared for that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the same as always.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
So let's get going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, let's go out to Neuestadt 
and take a boat to Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going to see 
<Woodrow>, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take this with you, big brother.
It'll come in handy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, thanks a lot. You're 
very thoughtful after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, how else am I supposed 
to take care of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay... fair enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, then, let's go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother, it's morning!
Come on, wake up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Big brother, you've really gotten 
better at sleeping and waking up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't keep giving 
you trouble, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's just boring.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Besides...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a special day. I woke 
up earlier than usual.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope we can all get together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me too...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]

Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you are a young man
of Lienea. When you are tired, 
don't hesitate to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you go home and rest 
for the first time in a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I will.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Aaaaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, <Lilith>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was someone peeking
through the window!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? Did you get 
a look at their faces?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
No. I couldn't tell for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I get it. I'll go see if I can
find anyone suspicious.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've found some shady people
from around the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother, you're so brave!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who the hell are you?
Tell me who you are!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, fess up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you're one of them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me too!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I had nothing to do with 
that. <Bacchus>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know him either. 
This is the guy, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, not <Bacchus>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh!	<Stahn>, you get it, don't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure, big brother?
Okay, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The culprit is in here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's not me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
So who the hell peeked in the bath?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
The bath...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Was it you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've shown your true colors!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
True colors?
So it's the girl then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, this boy is the one who 
peeped into <Lilith>'s bath!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't dare explain why I had 
asked everyone to come.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The two of them saw that 
<Lilith> was angry and just 
reflexively denied it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
But, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not a good idea to offend 
<Lilith> for any reason.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, you've got
to give up now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
... I peeked into your sister's bath.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a great big brother.
What's your name?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll remember that name!
My name is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you doing? You idiot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
But still, it's amazing <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm surprised to see you've 
suddenly changed your mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I tried to imitate the 
main character of a book I 
read a long time ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was cool.
Big brother!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, I'm back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I worred you had someting to do with
that thing in the sky. I've been 
worried about you for a long time,
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha, but I'm really glad. It looks 
like your business is done, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa will be home soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. What do you 
want to eat, big brother?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh? I'm not. What do you 
want for dinner tonight?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to ask me 
anything special today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>...
I'm not done with my business yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no, no... I knew it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it would come to this, 
when I saw my brother off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, your still in the middle 
of your business...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you need to 
do now, big brother?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since my brother left, I've been 
determined to do something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
He said that I shouldn't 
sway his decision.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
And best of all...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
He said I had to be strong too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Come on, swear to me
that you'll do what your
brother does!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll bring back the peaceful 
sky once again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear to you, brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will be stronger than anyone
else so that my favorite brother's 
promise can be kept!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother, you must 
keep your promise!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, and <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!

There was something stuck on the 
top of the tree in front of my house.

I think if you hit the arrow 
close enough, it will fall.

<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I understand.
I think I'll be fine.

We'll have to help with something.

It's okay, <Lilith>.

I'll be right back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas

Oh, you're early.
Are you done already?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I'm done with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's an egg.

Is this what's been bugging you?

<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.

It's hatched!

<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, she's so cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a little afraid of...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not fair, <Lilith>!
I'm the one who found you. Buu.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you think <Lilith> 
is your mother?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith> will be responsible 
for taking care of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh~. My brother is enough for me.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, take him for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, take him for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
How'd it go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was really nice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, but what are you 
going to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa. Can I ask you to 
take care of her for a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
You're still going to be 
with <Stahn>, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I'm sad to leave her, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
It's cute to think of him 
as our third grandchild.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about, Grandpa?
"Great-grandchild".
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Ho-ho-ho. That's right.
You're <Lilith>'s child, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Grandpa.
Where's the girl?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know where she is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then we have to find her!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did that girl just spontaneously
disappear?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yes.
I'm sorry, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did she grow up?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. she's much, much more grown 
than I was when I was born.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe it was a nesting trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sad that I won't be able 
to see him anymore, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a mother.
I should be happy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right <Lilith>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's too early for your 
brother to leave the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time you see him, maybe 
he'll bring his wife and kids!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If something like that happens,
<Lilith> can't be bothered with 
<Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Give me a break~.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Ho-ho-ho.<x00>
