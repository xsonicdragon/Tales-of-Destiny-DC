Mr. <Baruk>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not. Um,
who is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm <Stahn>, and you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I beg your pardon. I'm the
one who works here now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm Nash,
It's a pleasure to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash you said...
It's my pleasure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you want
to do <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Philia>.
Do you remember the 
name Nash anywhere?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash...?
Oh, I'm pretty sure it's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! It's Elena's father
from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know Elena?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
In fact, we do...
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. She wants to live with me,
not with her grandparents...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand.
I'll go meet Elena.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, That's a relief!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There's nothing in it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
While companies are making profits 
they should also contribute to the
community. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to support people here,
through the <Baruk> Foundation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll let you know if I get
any information. Until then,
you may stay here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish you hadn't been so reckless.
I'd be pissed off at General <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk> is really hoping for
the development of Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk> was unusually 
flustered when he found out
that you had left town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk>... Where
have you gone?
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think Mr. <Baruk> will 
ever come back. I have a feeling
he won't be back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't wait to be transferred
to Seinegald's headquarters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha!	What I just said?
Please don't tell anyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurry up to Seinegald's
headquesters. No, no, no.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk> is at Darilsheid's
headquarters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard Seinegald was attacked?
Is Oberon's headquarters okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if Mr. <Baruk> doesn't come back.
I will inherit his aspiration.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while, <Baruk>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, you've come. Did you ask the
townspeople where this place was?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I found my way on my own. The
people in this town don't have any
manners at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you should
be saying that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, look. There's something
cute over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. The people of Calvalese have
a strong wariness toward outsiders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
This prejudice has developed
over many years throughout 
history. Don't let it bother you
too much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of history...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
The ancestors of the Calvalesians
lost the ancient war.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was it... the Aeth'er Wars?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know how long ago this war
was, but they shouldn't let it affect
them forever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is a victor's logic. You have to
think about it like the losers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even now, the standard of living
in Calvalese is much lower than 
in other countries.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
For many years, they were oppressed
by other countries. Leading to the
current tension.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Baruk Foundation is stationed here, so
that the people here can have a greater
standard of living.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Baruk, you're an incredible person,
to be able to think like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never knew a place
like this existed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's easier said than done. I still
haven't achieved my goals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, we're getting off topic.
I received word from <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whatever this Eye of Atamoni is... it
looks like you're searching for it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, that's right. Do you know
anything about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've tried asking around, but so
far I don't have any clues.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are thoroughly investigating every
ship that docks in Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.
Until then you're welcome to stay 
in town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Got it. Then we'll
be in your care!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let us handle it. In any case,
that is quite a surprise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Watching <Lion> get along with
people his own age.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because we're friends.
We've gotten really close.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Right, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't say such disreputable things,
Baruk. These people and I are not
friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't say things like that. Haven't
we come all this way together?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The only reason why I've tolerated you
morons is because I was ordered to. I
never needed your help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm disgusted that you would think
we're friends, or that we even get
along. Got it? Don't say it again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't stand laid-back, careless,
overly-friendly people like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let the boy's words get to you.
He's always been rather abrasive.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fine. I know one day we'll
be able to get along.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I like <Lion>, I believe
he's a good guy deep down.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's something that's unexpectedly
easy to agree with.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
If his feelings ever do change, you'll
be sure to know immediately.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
