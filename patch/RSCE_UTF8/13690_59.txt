That look tells me something 
happened at the Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
We told <Stahn> and the others that we
would report this to <Hugo> as well, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was hoping that we
wouldn't run into him...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Lion>?
Tell me what happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tch...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the culprit escaped, hm?
That's quite embarrassing...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep your cool, Young Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, I shall report this
to the king, and have a
boat prepared for you at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No need. I will personally
apologize to his Majesty, myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you expect to accomplish
by going to him yourself?
Especially after failing in your mission...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Furthermore, this has sowed
the seeds of what will surely
become an international incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No! I will persuade
his Majesty by myself!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
...That's all well and good, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it would be best
if you allowed me to...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
How many times must I say this!?
I don't need your help!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can do just fine on my own.
I don't need to rely on you!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
M-Master <Lion>, be careful what you say!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.

you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
