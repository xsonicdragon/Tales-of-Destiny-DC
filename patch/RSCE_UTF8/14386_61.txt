Hey, <Stahn>. Are you

<TAG_007>We're going to save the world.
Kind of, you know...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
The World! You, <Stahn>?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Well, yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
And you're going to lie and run 
away from home again, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Stahn>, you're such a child!

[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
But I think that's 
typical of you, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your terrible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't help it, considering
the precedent. In fact, you're
still a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos> is terrible too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
You've become quite secretive, 
haven't you, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's not like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
But I guess I don't have a choice. 
You have such a pretty girl with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, 
I'm not involved!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. <Stahn> I thought you
were always going to be a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a great guy now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't be a girl forever.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, have a safe trip, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
He's missing. I don't know who to 
turn to in a situation like this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
He's missing. I don't know who to 
turn to in a situation like this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie. I'm here, aren't I?
This boy detective, <Stahn>, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You look more dependable when
you're acting like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're definitely better off doing 
that on a regular basis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> You know, there's a 
limit to what you can do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, it's exhausting to 
play someone you're not!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
More importantly, Aunt Maggie, 
how could you have known that 
Uncle was gone?
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Apparently, that guy was right 
in the middle of an aerial attack.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Just then, someone who had 
seen it told me about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, then, Uncle is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I know what I'm doing.
That man is alive.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not trying to hang on.
I just know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand.
I'm sure I'll find him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a bit of a misanthrope, you know.
And his bad luck is the strongest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But I don't have a clue.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you get hit by a Belcrant cannon, 
surely it's on the outer shell?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How could you come up with 
such an outlandish idea?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I have a feeling we'll 
see each other soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a reputation for having
good instincts. I'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't take her into
another's home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not safe for you to 
go out there with her.

Welcome. This is Lienea Village.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you have a pretty girl with you.
When did you get a girlfriend?

[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, are you with

[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>, what country is 
causing all this trouble?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald? Phandaria?
It's not Fitzgald, is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What is all this? Where did
this come from?

I miss the days when

Heh, from an egg.
I'm glad to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll go shopping 
for some fresh meat.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
The fun of going to Neuestadt is 
kicking rocks, even if the sky has
gotten weird.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
The only thing I look forward 
to when I go shopping in Neuestadt
is kicking rocks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll show you how much 
fun it is, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll share this fun 
with you, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to show you 
how to have fun, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Try kicking a rock that's fallen
in front of the village to Neuestadt.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, we'll try first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time, it'll be twice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time, it'll be three.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant

Next time, it'll be four.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat merchant

Next time, it'll be five.

Try as many times as you like.

I feel like the fire in

Now, now, Young Master.
You shouldn't speak 
to a lady like that.
[ENDBLOCK]

You can't leave her so down.
You should apologize.

Fine. Hey, you.
I went too far. I apol-

OK! I reckon I'll
let you off the peel,
just this once.

Let's toast to our meeting!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
...Toast?
You seem kinda fishy...

Sorry for the misunder<Stahn>ding!

going on a trip? That's great, 
take me with you!
[ENDBLOCK]

Take me on a trip, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> Brother, what's this about 
Belcrant and the Aeth'er War?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Belcrant?
Aeth'er War? What the is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, a monster 
came into the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
It didn't used to be like that.
[ENDBLOCK]

Aunt Maggie killed the monster 
that came into the village.

Well, <Lilith>'s got a boyfriend.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
You've come a long way 
to the countryside.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't just walk by, <Stahn>.
Go ahead, take a look.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
You've come a long way 
to the countryside.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't want to get hungry 
on the road. Buy some fruit.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a dangerous world we live in.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard you're a hero now.
Take the fruit.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I hear you're a hero.
Good luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh <Lilith>, that's a Pocket Dragon 
you got there, ain't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
It's said that their babies bring
more happiness than God does.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
You still haven't heard from 
your brother, have you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Most of our village is self-sufficient.
Even the women do the heavy lifting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Hotch... potch...
Yeah? I think it's <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a lot of energy, isn't it?
This is as easy as it gets!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Most of our village is self-sufficient.
Even the women do the heavy lifting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
When you are young, you should 
travel as much as you want. I used
to do the same.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not a good feeling to be 
looked down upon from the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about the village.
You do your thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
I still think I'm young, but your 
grandfather is quite old, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
I was amazed at how easily 
they took care of the monster 
that attacked the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Me and Thomas took care 
of the monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen this kind of dragon 
before, but it's pretty cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith> are you my mother?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus> You went to Neuestadt 
on an errand for your grandfather, 
but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
He hasn't come home yet.

[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you traveled from Seinegald?

[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, have you seen
any pointy-headed people who have
fallen by the wayside?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
A stray peckerhead?
I haven't seen him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. I'm a little relieved
to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you remember 
when we used to pluck all 
the flowers in our garden?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
In those days, I used to play 
pranks and my father used 
to get angry with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> Is this someone you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you know, if you ever 
want to come back to the village, 
you're always welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, please take care.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Who is the person running 
that broadcast?

[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Will I ever be able to talk 
to you in the sun again?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish I could have talked to 
you one more time under the 
sun, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to do what I can to help.
I have to protect the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>? I was wondering 
if there were any monsters
in the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you need help, just let me know.
It's just you and me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no. <Lilith>, why won't 
you turn around?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take care of that guy for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted you to stay in the village 
because <Lilith> would be sad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, well, it can't be helped.
I'll take care of you, <Lilith>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, don't you want to come 
back to the village instead of 
walking around outside?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're here, I'm sure <Lilith> 
will feel a little more at ease.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith> will be safe with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, you must be having 
a hard time with <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you being a good boy, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was the one who gathered up
all the lens in the village and 
carried them to Neuestadt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just don't waste any of it, okay?

What should I buy?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. We're all 
out of stock today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, are you running 
an errand for <Lilith>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're good, aren't you? 
You get to eat <Lilith>'s home
cooking every day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>'s, a really 
good cook, isn't she?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure there are other 
guys. We have to do something
about it now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, let's get you what you need.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you can have this if
you want. It's bargain beef!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you'll give it to me? 
Then I'll take it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell <Lilith> that I gave it to you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, I got it. It's a big,
delicious-looking fish.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
She'll make this for dinner.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
(Giggling)... <Stahn>, you 
look like you're having fun.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Suddenly you're back in the 
village, and now you're fishing
in the pond?
[ENDBLOCK]
You are such a funny guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not so sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
I've always liked you, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's embarrassing to hear you
say that out of the blue. 
...Do you want some fish?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks. But that fish is carefully 
kept by everyone in the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no.
[ENDBLOCK]
If they find out, they'll be upset.
You'd better put it back quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, but this...
I was thinking of making
this for dinner.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then you can take this with you.
I've just been shopping.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's extra-fine beef!
I shouldn't take this.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay. <Stahn> If I can 
help you, I'm happy too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'll take it without 
reservation. Thank you!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!

What's up, <Bacchus>?

... Are these the people who
are traveling with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>

Oh, yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>

<Lilith> You're with me,

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course.

Oh, you know, <Stahn> and <Lilith>.
Can I talk to you about something?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I felt like I had a... 
hole in my heart.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I find myself thinking about 
you all the time, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, um, I am.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
If <Lilith> disappears too, I ...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
And me ...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no one to make fun of!
<Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me, if I don't have someone 
I think is beneath me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm starting to feel like I'm the 
lowest person in this village!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother, give me that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>, you idiot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. Only <Bacchus> 
says it's stupid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!
I almost died!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? You look fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll be patient. I'm counting 
on you, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
My dream is that by the time I die, 
I'll be able to say, "I lived for 
... love!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
My dream is that by the time I die, 
I'll be able to say, "I lived for

<Bacchus>, what's with 
the abruptness?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I know what you're talking about!
<Bacchus>！
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

I'm living in love, too.

Lewein 
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, and you are?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lewein, aren't you a General?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you come to see 
grandpa by any chance?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lewein 
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir. Is Thomas there?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go get him now.
Please wait for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. Lewein...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lewein 
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a long time since I've
seen you, Thomas. I'm glad to 
hear you're doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I'm only getting older.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lewein 
[ENDBLOCK]
So, that one is ...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
My wife, a long time ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lewein 
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm very sorry to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lewein, does the general 
know about grandma?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lewein 
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, of course.
After all...
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Lewein!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's unusual, Thomas,
that you're upset.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lewein 
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, <Stahn>. I liked 
your grandmother too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no!	So you're saying that
I might have been the grandson
of a Seinegald general?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be ridiculous, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that were true, you wouldn't 
even be in this world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lewein 
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know about that.
<Stahn> You could really be 
my grandson, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess that's not a bad idea, but I'm
more comfortable being my grandpa's
grandson and brother of <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's one way to love a man!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm really sorry for suddenly
attacking you back in the forest...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought for sure
you were a bandit or something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's no big deal. Forget it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're...forgiving me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not repeating myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You even escorted me
back to the village...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, what were
you doing outside of the
village by yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was looking for
the Legendary Carrot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Legendary...carrot...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. I heard
that it's somewhere
here on Fitzgald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Forget that, though.
What did you need to do, here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here? I...uh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm looking for
the Softy Kreem stand...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem?
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think we sell
anything like that here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about finding
that stand your looking for!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Instead, how about we go look
for the Legendary Carrot together?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so strong! It'll
really help me out!
Come on, pleeeaase?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. If I change my mind, though,
I'll return to Neuestadt on my own.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK! That's fine!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I heard this
from grandpa.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Somewhere in a forest south
of here there surely rests
the Legendary Carrot of Legend!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see. Well, 
let's get moving, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah! Let's go
get that carrot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the second time
you've escorted me home safely...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much for
coming with me on my errand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, just tell me
one thing, would you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just what exactly do you intend
to do with that "Legendary Carrot"?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm gonna smack my big bro
upside the head with it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Upside the head?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! I'm
VERY angry at him!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
He just up and left us
one day wihthout a word!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if he comes crawling back,
I'm not gonna let him off easy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Well, be careful
not to accidentally
kill him, I guess...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got a real harsh mouth, but
you're actually a really sweet guy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph..don't say
such dumb things...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm heading
back to Neuestadt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
..Oh, wait..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I never got your name...<x00>
[ENDBLOCK]
