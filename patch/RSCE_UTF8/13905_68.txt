[ENDBLOCK]
Use your idiot powers 
to do something about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, leave it to me! 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<ITEM_149> should open it, right?

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You pried the door open.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems to be stuck.
You can't open it by hand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, there you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry for what I did to ...<Chelsea>.
I'll have to apologize later.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're all sick of me, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! You're driving me crazy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>. Can I tell you 
something more terrible?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sad at all about the
death of <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
In fact, I'm so angry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not like I'm going to
suddenly start calling him
my brother or something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The only family I have are the
little ones at the orphanage and
the sisters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care about <Lion> or <Hugo>.
I don't care about those guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
See? I'm the worst, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not? You think I'm a selfish,
cold-hearted person, don't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think so.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not? I didn't even 
cry like you did.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is that not cold-hearted!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>... You don't have to do this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it, I can't stand how empathetic
you are. I'm not kidding!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Maybe this is his plan, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's actually alive. He's looking
at us and laughing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And then, eventually, jump out.
He'd say, " Hmph" or "Hmmm".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no way he could have survived.
You know that, don't you, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then what do you want me to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What am I supposed to do!
What am I supposed to do!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hated that guy so much!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was so cocky and 
always so bossy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And we were only together
for a very short time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So why are you in so much pain?
Why are you so upset?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>, tell me!
Why are you doing this?	Hey!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not smart enough. I don't know 
what to say in a situation like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, at least.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
At least ...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's worry about it together. 
For his sake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my gosh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 
I'm so sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But thanks to you, I'm doing
a little better.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to stop <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think it's our parents 
after all. I'm sure it's the 
mismanagement of my family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it wrong to fight for 
a personal vendetta.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it isn't. I think you're
fine doing that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks,
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's get back to the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Okay.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
