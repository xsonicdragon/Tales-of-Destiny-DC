Hello, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, You want my autograph?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah. but have you guys stopped
playing the hero's yet?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big people like us can't
stay in one place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came here to take over
as champion at the arena.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
But there is no champion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess most of them got scared
and ran away. Hahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, dear!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, don't kill him.
Just hurt him a little.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's me...
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha, like a clown.
Your cheeks are red, haha.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, <Kongman>. The manager
would like to see you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I get it, I get it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Goodbye, <Philia>,
I'll see you soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If not being able to see 
me keeps you up at night.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Think of my name
softly in your mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha, ha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
(<Philia> isn't aware
of her feelings)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
(How can I make you understand
how important I am?)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a little hard when
you're dealing with someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, my God!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, I didn't think there
was anyone for <Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not because your
a champion or anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
But doesn't she kind of
look like ...<Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that right?
I'm not sure myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's true that their faces
may look a little alike.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But the voice of <Philia> is a 
little more delicate, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
"Mr. <Stahn>"? Is it like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, man, this guy. He's just
like <Philia>, isn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well, well. Let's trade
for <Philia>'s clothes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, please don't be silly. I'm
sure you don't like iteither.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you want to see 
<Kongman>'s reaction!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you know, if <Kongman>
likes it, I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, what's going on here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, Mr. <Kongman>. I've been
thinking about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...What's up with <Philia> being more
aggressive than usual! This is...!)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
(No, no, no, this isn't working...
Drink your tears and shun them...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, stay away from me...
If you think I'm always nice to you.
You're wrong. Don't make fun of me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe you noticed right
away that I'm not Ms. <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've had a bit of an epiphany.
Hey,<Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, it was a bit of a surprise.
<Kongman> went that far.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew <Kongman> was
the man to do it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if <Philia> will be a little
kinder to <Kongman> from now on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm jealous of
you, <Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't go beyond this point, unless
you're ready for battle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
The arena is just ahead. Please
proceed once you are ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
The city is being attacked by monsters!?
Erm... But I can't leave my post...
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now, a lot of people from 
the city have evacuated here,
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know if I can do this,
but I'm sure going to try.
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
The bed next to me is empty, so you
can go ahead and lose without worry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
Monsters in the city? Oh, God,
I'm so sick to my stomach!
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
Ow! Ow! Ow! My knee,
my knee, it hurts!
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it hurts. My teeth hurt.
I can't move like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'm going back into 
the field as soon as this 
whole thing dies down.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Only people who lose badly say
that they are almost there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Arena fights aren't really lethal,
but I'd hate for anything to scar your
handsome face. come down here to get your
cuts patched up so that doesn't happen, yeah?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of the people in town! 
I'm here to prepare for the wounded.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just glad that most
residents are safe. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
That man slept through
the whole mess!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
That patient is faking
his injuries.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to have to take care
of a patient while the world is
in trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll kick him out of bed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
That patient, I'm sure he'll
be back for something after
the fuss dies down.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Champ, you gotta do 
something about that guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Spectators
[ENDBLOCK]
Mighty!	Mighty!	Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mighty!	Mighty!	Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Th-they're cheering so loudly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe that <Kongman> guy is
something of a celebrity here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> is the hero of Neuestadt.
For years, his strength has gone
undefeated.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please stop this duel. There's
no meaning in fighting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't back down after
I came all the way here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're going through with this,
I won't let you lose. Are you ready,
<Stahn>？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> and <Dymlos> have gotten 
themselves all fired up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Basically, they're the same person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's time. We'll 
go sit in the stands.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... Please 
don't overdo it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right! Let's go!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
