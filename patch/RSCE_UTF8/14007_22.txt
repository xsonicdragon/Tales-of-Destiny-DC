<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a magnificent town. There are
so many new, beautiful buildings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the Oberon Company funding,
it looks like there's been a lot of
rapid growth here recently.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea it was this developed...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
 What, did you think it was all rural?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Th-that's?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-sorry, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, that guy...
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Bacchus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a childhood friend from Lienea.
Wow, what a coincidence!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came to Neuestadt to shop, but I
never thought I'd meet you here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
You took off so suddenly,
It kicked up a huge fuss.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah?yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
In other words, you ran away from
home. You really are something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
So yeah, when are you
coming back to the village?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm probably not coming back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something I have
to do no matter what.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't really tell you the details...
But at any rate, I can't come
home right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez. If you say it like that,
I'm not gonna ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you should at least write a
letter to your family. <Lilith> is
worried, you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll be going now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, see you around.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't want to needlessly worry
them, so I've kept quiet about
<Greybum>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the right choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't see <Mary> anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where did you go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem stand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you going off and
getting one by yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was yummy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enough, let's get going to
<Ilene>'s estate already.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since we've come all this way to
Neuestadt. Why don't we say hello
to <Ilene>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
She may not be there...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We passed through this
city on the way to Lienea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> hasn't been seen
in public for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if she's
going somewhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't have time for
a detour. Let's get to the
port and get on the boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, okay.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
