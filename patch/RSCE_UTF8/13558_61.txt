It's been a while since the 
last time I was on the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You almost got yourself killed 
the last time you were on board.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were having too much 
fun at a time like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so, Mr. <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. This guy
stowed away on the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was caught napping and got mistaken 
for a spy. Isn't that crazy?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've lead a very tumultuous life it seems.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were reckless and got yourself
into serious danger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's okay. After all, 
everything worked out in the end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, where's <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think he went inside earlier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is he not feeling well?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not good. I'm 
gonna go check on him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go with you.

[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, stop...
stay away...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it! Why is this
happening to me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to keep our mission a secret.
It's nothing personal kid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was just trying to hitch 
a ride to Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, wait!
[ENDBLOCK]
If we weren't carrying 'that', things
might have been different...
[ENDBLOCK]
Who threw that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
You bastard...! You brought 
accomplices with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-no, I didn't!
[ENDBLOCK]
What is that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Ship Crew
[ENDBLOCK]
A huge swarm of monsters are flying in
from ahead! There's hundreds of them!
[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible! Monsters attacking the 
Draconis, this can't be happening...
[ENDBLOCK]
What do we do, Captain!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Deploy the first battalion!
Don't let them get inside!
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now's my chance...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah-!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can still use 
that escape pod.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
