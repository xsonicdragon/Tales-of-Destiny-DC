[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe that they'd
call me a greedy woman...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, people have been treating us who
live in the mansion harshly, as though we
were the same as the Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been accused of being a greedy
woman after the company's fortune...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How could they say
such awful things!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Marian>, why don't
you leave this place?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That way, that way you won't
be hurt anymore, <Marian>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what he wanted...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Regardless,
you should go, <Marian>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No. I'm staying put!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You would go that far...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss... <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Marian>...I have
something to ask of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the future, when everything is properly
fondly remembered, you can visit...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you do, make sure
you get out of here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Rutee...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please...stop suffering so much
for people who aren't here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because if you're not happy,
I'm sure he'll be very angry...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, Miss <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome.
Are you here to see the
Master of the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Emilio?
Have you finished your work yet?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, don't push
yourself too hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome.
Are you here to see the
Master of the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, hang in there.
Don't be weak, don't give up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome.
Are you here to see the
Master of the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have a nice day, Emilio.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Emilio?
Have you finished your work yet?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have a nice day,
Master <Lion>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Master <Lion>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome.
Are you here to see the
Master of the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, don't push
yourself too hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome.
Are you here to see the
Master of the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for all your
help in this matter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take charge of the house
until Master <Lion> returns.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome, Mr. <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
So it's just you and me today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
... please, help us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Marian, if you will.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You sure took your time!
What were you even doing?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh come on,
give me a break!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dymlos, please calm down.
They don't know what's going on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
According to ancient texts,
there are six Swordians in all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of those, half are gathered here...
It's quite amazing to think of, no?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, so you're saying there's
three more Swordians out there?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, I shall now
brief you on the details.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are to go North
to Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You want us to make sure the
Eye of Atamoni is safe, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. That is priority number one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You got that right! This is my 
chance to finally become a knight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not even in the top ten!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well it should be! Don't rain 
on my parade, here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop talking like I've
accepted all this for nothing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know who I am, right?
I'm nobody's errand-girl!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
How's 200,000 Gald sound?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Awhuh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
As compensation for a job well 
done, of course. How about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... I d-dunno...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
250,000 then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-well, if you put it that way,
I-I guess that's acceptable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
She sure changed her tune.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
...She's certainly grown
to be one tough woman.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll put in a good word with
the King for you, too, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
So please, get the results
we're looking for.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Got it! Leave it to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I expect great
things from you.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007><Stahn> and <Rutee> Swordian
<center>devices can now be used.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Marian!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>, what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't talk that way,
no one else is here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
Sorry, Emilio.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... weren't you leaving?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought I'd come
see you one more time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had forgotten
to say goodbye.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that the only reason?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll miss you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're hopeless. Master <Hugo>
will scold you, you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't talk about that man!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio...
You shouldn't talk like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, <Marian>...
that was wrong of me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... I'll be back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio... please
be careful, OK?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will. Don't worry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...That <Stahn> guy, he said
some strange stuff to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He called me "a dear friend".
I mean, who talks like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
To me, it sounds like you're
happy to hear it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
D-Don't be so silly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pfft...
Please have another cup of tea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yes. Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyways...
I'm glad everything turned out okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed...
I really hope this is the end...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it just my imagination, or does it
feel like the calm before the storm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you say something, Emilio?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, nothing... I was just thinking
that your tea was delicious.
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>When I was a child...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>...I'd look up, and she would always
give me that kind smile.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>As time passed, I grew and no longer
needed to look up for that smile.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>However, being at the same eye level
was still not enough.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>My father never cared much about me.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>So I wanted to become an adult quickly,
to be independent of my father.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>I only wanted two things...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>...everything is for her sake,
and to be worthy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, Emilio.
I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just getting much 
warmer these days, so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Were you day dreaming again?
I won't stop you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Emilio,
don't tease me like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, are you on duty today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I don't have any duties today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I think I'll just take it easy 
at home today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, come on. Someone as young as you
shouldn't be saying things like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying, <Marian>?
You're not that much older than I am.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Although I'm happy to hear
that from you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not like our age gap
will ever close.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Pardon the intrusion.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Lion>, I've come to report that
there is an urgent task for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if it's an emergency,
who gave you permission to
barge into my home like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
F-forgive me, please.
However...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nevermind. Out with it.
What do they want with me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>, I'll leave you be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, sorry, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We've received reports that the thieves
we've been searching for have been found.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's so special about these thieves
that would require my presence?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You should be able to
handle this on your own.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what the captain said but
President <Hugo> insisted that you
should handle it, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>? In that case,
who are these thieves?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
They are <Rutee> Katrea
and <Mary> Argent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...Katrea?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
They're a pair of female thieves. The
Extortion is also among their crimes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It also appears that this time,
another person has joined their ranks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
According to the report, <Rutee>
Katrea seems to be in possession 
of a mysterious sword.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of that, they've been
able to evade capture up until now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
A mysterious sword?
I see, so that's how it is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood. What's their current location?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The Village of Harmentz.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The advance team has already departed,
it is requested that you depart at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I shall take my leave now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you hear that, Chal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I've heard enough
young master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
The "mysterious sword" they mentioned...
it's probably a Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
A Swordian other than Chal,
and the wanted criminal <Rutee> Katrea...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, if I remember correctly, isn't 
<Rutee> your long lost sister,
young master?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, we can't be sure yet. Besides, 
I've yet to meet her.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
At any rate, she's probably too much
for those useless soldiers to handle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal, let's hurry on
to Harmentz.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, young master.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>And so, my mission was over.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<x06><xD8><x00><x00><x00><TAG_007>"...To become an adult..."
[ENDBLOCK]
<x06><x15><x01><x00><x40><x06><x2A><x01><x00><x20>I wonder if I really
got what I was after...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Ironically, I got something
else on this journey. something
I didn't even know I wanted.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<x06><xD8><x00><x00><x00><TAG_007> "...Friendship..."
[ENDBLOCK]
<x06><x15><x01><x00><x40><x06><x2A><x01><x00><x20>Now I get it, what had
been growing within me every day...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Chal said something to me
in the middle of the journey.
[ENDBLOCK]
"You shouldn't be so focused
only on serious things like that."
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>I wonder if I'll
ever be able to admit it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well! You're up
early today, Emilio.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll hurry and
get breakfast ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know, why don't you join
me for breakfast, <Marian>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's kind of you to ask,
but I believe I will pass.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm expected at
the castle, today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem to have
become very busy, lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Compared to my trip around
the world, this is nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's already been two
months since then, hasn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It feels like yesterday that
I was saying goodbye to
<Stahn> and the others...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you feel lonely now that
your friends aren't with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Oh come on.
You know I'm not like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe~! You've
changed so much, Emilio.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that supposed to mean?
Did you like me better before?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not at all. The way
you are now is wonderful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, I just remembered.
Here, take this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
A little something I prepared.
May it protect you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And then that <Stahn> guy,
he said something weird to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he considered me a "good friend".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've told that story so many
times already. Every time, though,
it sounds like you had a wonderful time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Th-That's not
the case at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, here. Have
another cup of tea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, you've been in a very
good mood lately, haven't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's because...your tea is
always so good, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry to intrude, Sir <Lion>, but
something urgent has come
up that requires your attention.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for coming.
So, what's this urgent matter?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, I was not briefed on
the details. I was only told to request
that you report to the <King> at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Got it. I'll head
there right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then,
please excuse me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you
heard him, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Please be careful.
Oh! Wait, before I forget!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems Master <Hugo>
will be returning home, today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s coming back?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong, Master <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Nothing. I was just thinking
I haven't seen him in a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, I'll be back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
See you soon!

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
