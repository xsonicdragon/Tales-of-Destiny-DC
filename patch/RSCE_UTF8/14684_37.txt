... We should all perish.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We are going to die,
aren't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you find what you
were looking for?
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma
[ENDBLOCK]
It's unusual for a stranger
to come here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma
[ENDBLOCK]
Are we going to be taken
to a new world?
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma

[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma
[ENDBLOCK]
What use is that
blue rock for?
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma
[ENDBLOCK]
First the blue rock, now the lens.
You guys are in trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you want in this town?
Have you come to laugh at us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
... Our time has finally come.
The legend was true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are they targeting us too?
That's ridiculous... It can't be...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I've always thought of you
strangers as my enemies.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
To be honest, I can't accept
being called a friend now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
... This is Junkland.
As the name implies,
it's a city of garbage.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if I will die by lightning,
after being forced to live a hard life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
...Your story wasn't bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe we can
help save the world...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We were still worth living for...

<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Junkland...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where in this city can I get 
some kind of Berselium?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's ask someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hello, excuse me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Could you please tell me where
the Berselium is located?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Berselium is, uh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is a metal with a 
unique blue luster.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, it looks blue.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Calvalese,
right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd heard that the Calvalese
were reclusive, but I hadn't
realized how far...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
People of Junkland, 
please listen to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We need your help to bring
the light back to the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The world has become what
it is because of <Miktran>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because <Miktran> is back and has 
covered the sky with this outer shell!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must defeat <Miktran> and 
restore the world to normal!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
For that, we really, need some Berselium!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, please, please, help us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No one?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's no use. We'll take 
care of it ourselves.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Industrial waste from long ago 
must have accumulated into a pile.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
So let's focus on
that mountain.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, let's go.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
