[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wooow, the sea is huge!
It's so calming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is exciting! It's my
first time on a ship.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Remember we are not on vacation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... um... what is it...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, what do you know
about the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Honestly? Not much. I've read a
little about it in the past, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then can you tell me anything about
it? I'd never ever heard of it until 
recently, so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-yes, of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you know about the
Aeth'er Wars? The war between
Earth and Heaven?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The story is usually spread as a myth,
but it's based on real history.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A war between... Earth and... Heaven?
Is that right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's exactly as it sounds. It was a
war that split the world in two.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The books I read say that the
Eye of Atamoni was the cause
of the Aeth'er Wars.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
"The cause of the great calamity
that befell the world".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I believe it. I saw it for
myself. It had an ominous,
overwhelming presence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't let that thing get into the
world. No matter what, we have
to get it back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. You're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, you're really smart right?
From here on out, please teach me
everything you know, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've brought Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, you don't look so good.
Are you doing okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we're going to be chasing 
<Greybum>, I have a proposal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as they possess the Eye of
Atamoni, we'll need to strengthen
ourselves.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, there should be a place in
the sea nearby where a Swordian
is sleeping.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I'm correct, it's inside a ship that
sunk into the sea near the Second
Continent a long time ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Swordian's name is <Clemente>.
He would no doubt be useful to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should go get him, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fine, isn't it? Let's go.
This is a great opportunity.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And this time, I can pawn it
off for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And do you know exactly where
this transport ship sunk?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's go then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>! Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A fourth Swordian, huh? Sounds fun!
I wonder what this one is like?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>. Um... thank
you very much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to your consideration for me,
I've calmed down quite a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's still plenty of things I don't 
know but if there is anything you'd
like to know about from now on. 
Just ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll answer you to the
best of my ability.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice! I'll be counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good work, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did I do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't even realize it? Well,
that's fine. That's just the kind
of person you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> got away
from us once again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not anyone's fault. We'll 
surely get him next time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
About <Greybum>, what was he
like back at the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was incredibly intelligent,
and extremely pious. Someone
you could look up to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Many priests adored him. He had
many devout followers, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That reminds me. We didn't
see <Batista> in Calviola at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Another priest, and <Greybum>'s
most trusted aide. I considered
him to be my mentor, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, you'd dare disobey 
High Priest <Greybum>?
Foolish girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since you're so hard-headed,
I reckon it's only fitting to
have a stone body to match!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sorry... I was just
lost in thought.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'll be on the deck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>'s face didn't look so good.
Think he'll be okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, isn't he always like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to Aquaveil,
but what kinda place is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, Aquaveil is not just
one single state.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the general name for a
group of allied provinces:
Shiden, Moreau, and Terazzi. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The countries are made up
of many islands, and 
they come and go by boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> said that they were hostile?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
They've imposed a policy of national
isolation. It's almost impossible
for anyone to make contact.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Their relations with Seinegald are
particularly bad. She was probably
referring to that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard through the grapevine that
Aquaveil has a really strong navy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What if they're connected
to that Armada?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder about that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to think for a bit.
I'll be on the deck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, the Eye of Atamoni's...
I didn't think it was possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is going to require
more of my help!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way. Why did <Philia>,
first come to me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? It's that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so sorry.
Did I bother you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you, <Stahn>!
Don't be mean to <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not being mean. I was just...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wondering why you didn't
join up with <Lion> first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because he's supposed to
be the closest one, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> is at... We have no 
idea where he went.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia> had asked the <King>
and the General. There was 
no clear answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried about him...
I hope it's not too weird.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier> is with him.
I'm sure they'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's hurry up and join the others,
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is <Stahn> doing...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's just standing there on the
deck with a scary look on his face.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's too good-natured.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I told him to learn to be a 
little less trusting of others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, I hope you're okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> has great compassion 
for people. That is why he is
suffering now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's up to all of us to support him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
