<Batista>! You have nowhere
left to run!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you've finally shown 
yourselves! This time, it 
won’t go like before!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have the tiara...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've already gotten rid
of that worthless thing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>, it's not too late. You
can stop helping <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can still return to your old
self, when you were earnestly
devoted to our faith!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, what a naive little girl.
Even from the beginning, I
never believed in the goddess.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
I follow <Greybum> because
it feels right! Nothing more,
nothing less!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Unforgivable...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you false lord. Where
are you keeping <Fayte>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Locked away in a cell. I have
to take good care of him until
his execution!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. Hearing that calms me.
Now I can play your funeral
march without worry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>... I will not allow you
to speak words that desecrate
the goddess!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
And just how will you do that,
<Philia>? What can an indecisive
person like you do about it?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guaghh... This wasn't... But the
power... I got from <Greybum>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh... Despite everything,
you've grown strong, <Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Finish me off... the man who...
degraded your beloved goddess.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you not do it? Of course
not... You're just like I said.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Far too gentle... you'll need
to become more bloodthirsty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go rescue <Fayte>. 
There's another cell behind
the door over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry... Would you allow
me to stay here by myself
for just a little longer?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry <Stahn>, I've been
thinking a lot about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No need to apologize.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think what <Batista>
did is acceptable. But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was a time when
this man was a devout priest
and a good mentor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's all I want to believe...
Is it wrong for me to be like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it isn't wrong. You're
fine the way you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so kind. It's what
makes you you, <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
