[ENDBLOCK]
Vrooooom~!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey now! How many times
do I have to tell you!
Don't run around in the house!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fiiiine! I'm the Draconis!
I'm flying all over the world~!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about my son.
He didn't hurt you, did he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're fine. He handles
the rudders really well~
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe~
big bro gets it!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's such a lively kid!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right then! Big bro is
a new model of the Draconis!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe!! An imposter can't hold
a candle to the real thing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Draconis 2.0 ready for liftoff!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Vroooooom~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, by the way, wasn't the entire
existence of the Draconis completely
clasified by the military?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's correct. But by this point
it doesn't really matter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, I wonder if that's really
the case?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... excuse me, but are you
in the members of the military?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not, but you're right
about this guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm really sorry about that.
You see, my husband is part 
of the Draconis's crew.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Before everything happened,
he carelessly told our son
about the Draconis. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
He's off traveling the world now,
so he doesn't get to come home 
very often.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
And since he's so lonely, he's started
acting like he's the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I think he wants to travel
alongside his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it not all right to talk about
the Draconis to the military?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's fine.
But the Draconis is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Iyaaa, that was so fun!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey hey, mom! This guy said
he rode on the Draconis!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? These people here
are soldiers.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Really??
Then does dad know them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your dad? Heh...
what does he do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't have free time
to play around here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, we're leaving now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
See you later~!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, come by again!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that? You showed a pretty
unexpected side of yourself
just now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. They haven't received
the death notice yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If he talked about it before,
it probably ended in a court martial.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The boy misses his father...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
My husband has been away
at work for some time now.
I'm getting a little worried.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been asking the military
about my husband, they won't
tell me anything...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Even in a world like this, I feel
I can make it if I have a family.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please do your best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please do your best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Please Dad, I'm tired of
waiting for you to come home!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
My father hasn't come home for
a long time. What's wrong with him?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, where's Dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm happy you're here, Daddy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck, 
big brothers!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Big sisters!
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck, big brothers!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Big sisters!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
