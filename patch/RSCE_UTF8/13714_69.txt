They're dangerous!
[ENDBLOCK]
<IGNORE>
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't move!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think you're doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's you! Stand down! Return 
the <Queen> and we'll spare you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh？ The <Queen> hasn't
returned...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?	Has the <Queen>
been kidnapped？
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Y, you fool！
This is top secret！
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that not good...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, was she really kidnapped？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it.
He's <Woodrow>, Phandaria's King.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
F...!?
Forgive my conduct！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, you received a letter saying 
the <Queen> had been kidnapped...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes... in fact, no one has seen
the <Queen> since then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where in the world
could she be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If someone kidnapped the <Queen>,
they'd take her to a secluded place...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
For example... a desolate location
like a forest or abandoned house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Desolate... are there
any places like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you guys
are suspicious.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
No way! Is there an army of
volunteers against the kingdom?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected, it would be difficult
to cross the border with the <Queen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
There was a report that a suspicious
group had left west of the city...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, do not be disrespectful 
to the <Queen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Queen> is deeply troubled
by this series of events.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish I could confort the
<Queen>. I wish I could...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Queen> is pleased with your
work. She's counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Queen> wishes you all
the best. She is very happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I've always been
pleased with your work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty was extremely pleased.
Keep up the good work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are relying on any
assistance you can provide.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure it's hard
on you, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
... I never expected to be
disappointed in this way...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was <Hugo> intending to do this
from the beginning?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
What will happen
to Seinegald...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, I'm begging you all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's time for the final showdown.
We believe in your victory, sir.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
