[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a good experience for me
to take back to my homeland.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
So you found the [Foundation Stone]?
Isn't it the perfect spot to hold a meeting?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I see you've found the [Golden Butterfly].
It's just as gorgeous as the name implies.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You found the [Tricorn]?
It looks imposing at a glance,
but it's actually kinda cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice job finding the [Gloomdrop].
So they only bloom on nights
when the moon's gone...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
That's inspiring.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You found the [Sand Geoduck]?
Sailors used to keep them as charms.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
They figured if the critters
couldn't dance around on the
beach, the seas might stay calm.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
So you found the [Flying Manta].
To think something so big could fly...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Crazy, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
So here's what
I've got for you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a building
somewhere near Darilsheid
[ENDBLOCK]

where peddlers
will go to meet.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I hear there are islands
isolated out at sea
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
that are home to
some rare insects.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a creature out at
sea with some strange horns,
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
but it's so rare that
it's seldom ever seen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a plant out there unique
enough you'd spot it instantly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
They say it's like a beacon
of hope in a darkened world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It was...on some island somewhere,
but I can't remember which.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard of a creature that's
earned itself some tall tales.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Hrm, it was near some beach.

Do you mind if I come in?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me.

[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know what to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just now, while you were
talking with me, it clicked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone who will always 
be in <Stahn>'s mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...That's the answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The rest... I don't have
to tell you, do I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you.
I'll be back in a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure this was 
the right thing to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Both of you are insensitive and clumsy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I don't push you like this, you
won't be able to help yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aside from being insensitive, 
you're also quite clumsy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay. This is the position that 
I myself have chosen to take.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know when I was going to do it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not a good spot to be in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
But I think you're...
I think you're a good woman.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you've just realized that?
It's such an obvious thing.
[ENDBLOCK]

You're awake, which is 
unusual for you.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
