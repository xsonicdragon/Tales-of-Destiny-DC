[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning. Mr. <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no!
Stop it, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Change the recording to browse mode.
Play the video.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't seem to be stopping!
What's going to happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh-huh, it's okay <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no, not good!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is where our alter
ego will be born.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess so.
But I feel sorry for...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can be together like this, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our alter egos will live forever, but...
We can never be together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. I can't imagine how hard it must
be to not be with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will live together for the
sake of our alter egos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, <Dymlos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's not! Absolutely not!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to talk like that
anymore, <Dymlos>, do you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this an old record of
<Dymlos> and others?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, <Stahn>. One of my colleagues
at the time took the trouble to record
it for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Why do we need this stuff now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's nice. It's a 
memory of you and me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The video was cut off at "and chew". 
What happened after this "chew refusal"?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my god, <Rutee>.
After this, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah, <Stahn>. I've hidden 
my treasures over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, come on, let's go get it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>, you were so much more
passionate when you were human.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm embarrassed because
<Stahn> is here.

What is this place...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait...Could this be...?
It's the Swordian R&D Lab!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Swordian R&D Lab?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, we Swordians 
were created here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you see the six 
chambers in the back?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our original masters stood
in those chambers, and imprinted
their personalities onto us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's really been a thousand
years since then, hasn't it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Feeling nostalgic?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Kind of, yes.
Everyone was there, too...
[ENDBLOCK]

Swordian Engineer?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. He was an
absolutely brilliant mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Kind of unpredictable, though.
You never knew what he'd do next...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>. Hold me
up to that light, there, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>

Are you gonna be okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>

Don't worry about me.
I'm certain it'll prove useful!

Is this the device that will 
enhance the Swordians?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Let's hope it works properly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, go to the control 
panel in front of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't seem to be broken.
I think we've passed the first
hurdle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's get started.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, you must put us Swordians
in each separate chamber.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aaaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aaaaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't shut it down!
Maintain current output!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-okay...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is everything okay with...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think? I guess we'll
just have to wait and see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please... hold on, Swodrians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>, are you all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. It seems to have
worked somehow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our physical enhancements 
are now complete.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't seem to 
look any different.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's inside is something else...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The rigidity of the blade, the 
efficiency of energy conversion.
Everything is much improved.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay...! Well, I 
guess we're next.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. As soon as you are ready,
you may enter the chambers with us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
From now on, our consciousness will
travel to a place that is of this world
and not of this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is where we will 
face our final test.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What happens if we fail?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll never wake up again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if there is no physical
damage, your consciousness 
will be completely lost.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's as good as dead.
You're right. It's a one-shot deal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you said you wanted to 
get closer to my former master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you keep talking like that, you're
not going to make it back alive.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not enough to get close!
If you're going to do this, you're
going to have to go beyond!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I get it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, all of you, enter the chambers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, turn it on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you guys will be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're definitely coming back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, here we go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>, are you okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you understand me, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hang on, <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like you made it through
the ordeal in one piece.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You understand?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. You look so different. It's like
I've been blown away, for real.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you all for your concern.
We've achieved our goal safely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We were not fighting, 
just us, were we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The thought of our friends wishing
for our return gave us strength as 
we faced our ordeal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see my prayers have been
answered! I'm so happy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... we've beaten the
final test, haven't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. You've done well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right!	Let's keep going at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This time, I'm going
to beat <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the spirit, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like we could do
anything right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, like...
I can even break
the Eye of Atamoni!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's not what
I'm talking about.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with the attitude?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're getting carried away!
This is what happens when 
you're not careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the one who's 
been nagging me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come to think of it, we're a strange
group of people, aren't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, we are a large group
of twelve people. And the ones 
who are there are all weird!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm? Who says I'm weird?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well, I guess I know who's
the best of them all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well. Now that we're getting into the
swing of things, let's get to our next
destination, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe it was Junkland,
in Calvalese.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
