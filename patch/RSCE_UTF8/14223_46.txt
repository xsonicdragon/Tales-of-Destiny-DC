Glass is a dullard, but when

Nyan! Do you know anyone

From the looks of it,
you're not free, Nyan!

However, it is only in the midst

the value of freedom, Nyan!

[ENDBLOCK]
I never imagined that
this day would come.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a good experience for me
to take back to my homeland.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you find a natural hot spring?
It's a mixed bathing area.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, there are only old people
here. It's not my place to say.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You've found a giant
snowman. It's too big to
be made by human hands.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
And it's too well shaped to
be a natural creation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
No way, a monster!
It can't be ...can it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you found the candle
tree? The lights shining in
the snow-clear air.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It's very moody.
...What? It's a dead language?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
So, here's what I've got for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Frostheim is famous for its hot
springs, but there is also a secluded
hot spring that can cure all kinds of
diseases in a remote place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. You'll have to find
it yourself. It is, after all, a
hidden hot spring.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It is said that very large chunks
of snow appear overnight in the
area of Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
What's a snowball?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
The last time I saw a peddler,
the number of travelers in the
city had declined due to the
event two years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he was going to go make
some money since he had more.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Young people seem to be looking for
the hottest spots near the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like someone's playing
a prank, but the people in town
seem to be very grateful.

<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ughhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank goodness...
You're awake...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Woodrow>?
...Where am I...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're in the city of Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've been saved. Thanks 
to the people here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Long time no see, <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought I was a goner...
You all saved my life!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much for your
help. I don't know what I would
have done without you guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
They've been after us
since we left Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not surprising, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on? Why's 
everyone staring at me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were travelling with <Woodrow>
and didn't even know who he was?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This man's name is <Woodrow>
Kelvin. He is the prince of the
Kingdom of Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAAT?! 
The Prince of Phandaria?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
A normal person would
recognize that name immediately.
A normal person, that is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, is this the reason
you were so keen on helping him?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's obvious that you're
looking for a reward.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-oh, shut up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't bother to tell 
him what he didn't know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I also had to pretend I couldn't
hear you. I'm sorry, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...! You knew that I existed?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, are you the
master of <Igtenos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was the name of a Swordian
who was enshrined here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos> was owned by my father,
The <King> of Phandaria, Isaac.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you own it? Where
is <Igtenos> now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It fell into the hands of
...<Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My father fought bravely
against the rebels who 
attacked the castle, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
He crossed swords with <Greybum>...
...and was defeated.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
So they took <Igtenos> from you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd hate to think that <Greybum>
has the makings of a master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the <King> was overthrown, it's as
good as the end of the country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's terrible!
Why would you say that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>'s still here, after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a blessing in disguise that
we happened to be in the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't have to make <Woodrow>
follow in his father's footsteps.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what are you going to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've already sent out notices
throughout the kingdom.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
But we'll need some time 
to get our forces in place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then we'll head to
Heidelberg first!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you guys are?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. The sooner, the better.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It would be easier to get things 
moving with a smaller group.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, we've been chasing
<Greybum> to get the Eye of
Atamoni back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't realize that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'll come with you.
I know how to get in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wouldn't it be better for you
to stay in this city, <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The cause of this disturbance
was that our royal family was too 
comfortable in our safety.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to take responsibility
for disturbing the country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'm coming too! I'll be with
<Woodrow>, where he goes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What can a child like you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Phooey! I'm not a child!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can take her with you.
Despite her appearance, 
<Chelsea> is a skilled archer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean, by my appearance?
Even Grandpa thinks I'm a child too!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright. Let's
all go together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll tell you how to get to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The fastest way would be through
that forest where we met.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
As I recall, it was to the west,
after leaving Frostheim.

Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
