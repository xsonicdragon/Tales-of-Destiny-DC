Ah? There's a sword!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is <Clemente>.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Chosen heroes, you've done well
to come this far.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that, who're you
callin' heroes?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? Are you really
talking about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Old <Clemente> here likes 
to play pranks on people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pranks...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well, it's been quite a while,
Dymlos. You're still as stubborn as ever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
You never even wrote, <Clemente>. But
you seem to be doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Atwight. You're as sweet as ever.
You became a sword, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you've gone through all the trouble
to come meet me here, then something
must be happening.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is... the Eye of 
Atamoni was stolen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
So it was true... I had a
bad feeling.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
This isn't the time for me to be
sleeping peacefully.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you come with us? It'll be
reassuring if you do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be counting on you to spoil me
and whip these old bones into shape.
Hehehe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't let you do anything
weird to Atwight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Spoil you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh I get it, like polishing and
refining. Because you're a sword.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, not quite. More like, brimming
with romance, perhaps.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dymlos. It seems like your master
is quite the pure-hearted man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, how are we gonna get
<Clemente> a master?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will have to think about that
later. No one here possesses the
aptitude to wield a Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
My master is already here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's coming here... <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How did you manage to get here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I listened to the voice in my head,
it guided me here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You heard a voice... could 
that really be <Clemente>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, it really was.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are the one who called me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was your will that wished for me.
Your earnest desire and determination
to become stronger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
And that is why you heard my voice.
I can give you that power.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
All that's left is your final decision.
What do you choose? <Philia> Felice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to get the Eye of Atamoni
back from the High Priest...
no, from <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter what. That is my
responsibility, my duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will fight together with you.
Grant me your power. ...<Clemente>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You did it, <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all because you encouraged
me, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, once again I ask you to
let me fight with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with that, you still won't
recognize <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hmph. Just don't be a nuisance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes! Leon, thank you
so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, you are still a novice.
That means you are weak.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, what you lack in skill, you
make up for in your earnest feelings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have great expectations for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please give me your guidance, <Clemente>,
and everyone else too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Same here. Pleased to make your
acquaintance again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good to have you along.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep yep.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This ended up being a
convenient affair.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mhm. With this we can have some
peace of mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
At any rate, if I had to get a new
master, I'm sure glad she's a spritely
young girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, everyone. Shall we
return to the ship?

Yeah, sounds good.

That's correct.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome, Swordian team!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
After so many years, I am relieved 
to be able to gather with everyone 
again, like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that <Ritora>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a holographic image.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a new master, there are still many
things you may not understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
While I answer any questions you may 
have, I would also like to determine 
how resolve the situation henceforth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'd like to ask you 
something right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, exactly, is <Hugo> trying to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Terraforming the earth to create
the Outer Shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Terra...forming...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The chunks of earth broken up by 
the Belcrant are drawn into the sky
to create a new layer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is the formation of the outer
shell of the earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Spreading like ivy in the sky is the 
newly formed outer shell itself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The current level of completion 
is about 25 percent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I estimate that if Belcrant fires
three more blasts, the sky 
will be completely covered.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that happens, the earth 
we are on will be...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
It will become a world of complete 
darkness, and all life will die out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
So we must stop it before that
happens. Don't let our earthly 
world be ruined.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do we need to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will use the blitzkrieg strategy
we used in the last war.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to levitate the Radisrol 
to the surface and lay it directly on 
Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The surface? Did Radisrol always
have such a feature?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. And get the Swordian
team inside Dycroft!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the same thing we were trying
to do with the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's like a repeat of what happened
one thousand years ago all over again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You think Radisrol can reach altitudes
that the Draconis could not?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's correct.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The goal is to defeat <Hugo> and 
take back the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not too late. Now, before 
the outer shell is complete.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's going to be a race against time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. Therefore, we have to launch 
the operation as soon as possible and
settle this matter at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take care of it. I'll make sure to 
take out <Lion>'s enemies as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...? You are a weird one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before the mission, there is 
a place I want you to go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're right near the 
Village of Lienea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? I didn't 
realize that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
While you go get the R key,
I'll continue to analyze the 
information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
To be able to handle any 
situation that may arise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me help!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can find it at...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is a problem that should 
be addressed jointly by all 
human beings on earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I, too, wish to participate in the 
mission as a representative of 
Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This man, how did he get here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like they were following 
us and boarded Leviathan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's truly amazing. I can't believe 
such advanced technology existed
in the olden days!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, please let me do this.
I will do whatever it takes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't it scary for you, to suddenly
be a part of this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't have much time. 
I will put him to work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good, then we will go 
and get the R Key.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's southwest from Radisrol.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, you have made it 
back here in one piece.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No time for greetings. Let's get started 
on the neutralization device.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here it is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. Connect the device 
to the Swordian to neutralize
the specular barrier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how we'll get 
close to Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now all we have to do is 
figure out a vehicle to get
into the Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. We're going to go through 
Josaia to get to Mikheil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
To retrieve a floating cruiser.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, let's get moving!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, Swordian team, 
for your hard work in getting
the R key.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will now begin preparations
on our end for the surfacing of
Radisrol.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want you all to prepare yourselves
for the coming battle and keep your
wits about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been assigned as Commander 
<Ritora>'s assistant. I look forward to
working with you all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
How long will it take to 
finish the preparations?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait a little longer.
I'll report back as soon as I'm done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to lose it if I sit around
and do nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything has been moving
so fast these past few days.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything that has happened
so far feels like a dream.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not dreaming that <Lion> is gone.
I'll definitely avenge him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, I'll take care of this.
I'll kill that bastard <Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, no.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not? What's wrong with that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it? Did I say something 
I shouldn't have?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Actually, <Hugo> and <Lion> 
are really father and son.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That means...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. That <Hugo> is apparently 
also my father.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
You didn't know that about...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's not why. I don't 
think anything of it, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no way that I would have 
any feelings for someone I've only 
met a couple of times.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, don't be so gloomy.
It's not your concern.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just because <Lion> says it's true, 
doesn't necessarily mean it's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
After what he's done, there's 
always the possibility that he
was lying, you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't talk like that...
I feel sorry for <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So what would you do if 
you were in my shoes?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...crying...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be around. Give me a 
shout when you're ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guys, I'm sorry about earlier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. And... <Chelsea>.
I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay. It was my fault. I'm
sorry for being so direct.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need to apologize to everyone, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All I could think about was 
getting vengeance for <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though my mouth was saying
other things, in the end, it was all
I could think about.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... that's not good enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The first thing we need to think about
now is how we're going to handle this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I only realized that after
talking it through with <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, have you finished
sorting out your thoughts?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even now, there are still things 
I need to consider. But right now,
more than anything...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I have to fulfill my 
responsibilities as a master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I agree with 
what <Stahn> said.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not just the Swordian Masters.
Don't forget about us, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. Everyone here 
is an important friend.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So let's all work together to 
end this war at all costs!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm-hmm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian team, we're 
ready to launch!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once we have surfaced, it's 
a short walk to the Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, are you ready to go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Absolutely!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's get this thing started.
Main engine, ignite!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Main engine firing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Radisrol, rise!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What just happened?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Earth Dwellers, you fools! Why would
you try the same approach twice?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I was already prepared for 
you to try it again.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The Guardian Dragon is circling above.
We are prepared for you.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Do you like it?
You no longer stand a chance!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You will become a sacrifice to the
Guardian Dragon and be reduced to
dust for the Outer Shell!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, are you okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are using most of our remaining
power to deploy a defensive shield.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can hold on for a little longer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
In fact, in addition to the Guardian 
Dragon, there is one other thing that
is troubling me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>, display our video
feed of Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like there's something 
covering the area around Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The mirror barrier is 
deployed on all sides.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's almost impossible to get through
it by hitting it head on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if we take care of the
Guardian Dragon, we still must
deal with the barrier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is ridiculous. How
can <Hugo> do so much?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is it that he knows so much 
about aerial cities and the
Aeth'er Wars?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
He knows too many details, even if 
the information wasn't completely
covered up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to believe that this
knowledge comes from just 
researching historical records.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I don't know anything about that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter what <Hugo> knows 
or does, we can't lose!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there anything you 
can do, <Ritora>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We analyzed all the information
available to us and considered all
possible operational plans.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We do have a countermeasure. The
odds of success are slim, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd like to hear more details.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
First of all, I'm going to make a
device to neutralize the specular
barrier right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
While we wait for the device to be 
completed, I would like you to occupy
the other aerial cities of the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>, current status.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the time you reach Miktran,
we'll have completed the 
neutralization device.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we can coordinate with each other, 
we can approach Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's going to be a tough road, 
but will you do it? Everyone of
the Swordian team.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course! Even if it's impossible,
I'll take my chances against it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that what we all do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, yeah. If we don't have a choice,
we'll just have to do it, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No need to ask again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will do everything we can to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to end this war at all costs.
It must be us, by our hands,
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's do this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll do my best too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right!	Then let's get to work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, sail to your first 
destination, Ignasea!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, take this with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
With this, you can call the 
Leviathan at any time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Use it near a shore. You can only
enter and exit it from there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is an absolute requirement 
for calling the Leviathan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't forget.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
