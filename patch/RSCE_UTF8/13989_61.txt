She was all, "You
won't grow if you don't
eat your veggies"

[ENDBLOCK]
So I have
a question for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there any food that you don't like?

I'm not particularly picky, but...
I really don't like sweets.

Oh, reaaally~?

Yes, really. 
You don't believe me?

I saw you staring at the
Softy Kreem stand, you know.

I completely adore the princess.
But I'm the son of a simple farmer.

Man

Even though her head knows the 
difference in status, her heart will
not let her give up on the princess.

Hostess

Well, do you love me that much?

Hostess

That's the pure love I've always wanted!

If we were to fish in the harbor, the
fishermen would give us the evil eye.

Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Where did you guys hear that broadcast?
I'm really surprised, aren't I?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
You never know when a monster is
going to attack. Fishing is also
a deadly business.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys are collecting lens?
What are you going to use them for?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a very nice woman downtown.
I wonder if I can get close to her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that guy downtown wasn't
injured in the commotion...

Man

The other day, I was seen with my
sister by that guy from downtown.

Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope I'm not misunderstood...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder how they are feeling right now.
I want to go check on him, but... hmmm.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that if I were
to go to the downtown area,
I wouldn't be safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... What should I do?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish they'd get rid of the arena.
I hate dealing with those hoodlums.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It was this square that
suffered the most damage.

[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
On the contrary, it was fortunate
that the damage was concentrated
so that it could be quickly restored.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Ms. <Ilene> is too lenient with
people from downtown. I'd give
them a piece of my mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as Neuestadt is safe,
I don't care about the rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a bad situation indeed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you just want lens?
I'll provide you funds for the army.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
So please, please, please!
Please help us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not gonna do it just to watch you.
Get away from me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I have my Softy Kreem Shop
back. I'm so relieved. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I had to buy another Softy 
Kreem because it melted after
all of the excitement.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
There are more kids from downtown
hanging around here these days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure Neuestadt isn't the only
one that doesn't want to be hit.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish I could ask my dad to
move me somewhere brighter.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy

Dad, wants me to try and get along with
people going forward. I wonder why?

<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the Softy Kreem stand
<Mary> was talking about, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, can I get five please?
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem Stand
[ENDBLOCK]
Which flavors would you like?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohh, there are a bunch to choose
from. Which one, which one...?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, which should I pick?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
The standard mocha flavor, or the
limited cherry... Which one should
I choose...? How troublesome.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, if it were you, which
would you choose?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? Me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it were me... I'd definitely
go with vanilla.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Why vanilla?? You heard me
say mocha or cherry, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you can't decide between two
options, then your answer is a
third option... or is that wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
 I see, I hadn't thought of that...
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'll do that. Sir, one vanilla!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, me too. Five vanilla!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry for the wait. Here's five vanillas.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmm, delicious! The vanilla flavor
here is really the best!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
If you eat here just once, no other
shop will be able to satisfy you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you want me
to help carry them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah, I'm good.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my, these are your companions?
You're both so cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You flatter me, thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...? Those children...
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Yoohoo~ Do you all want some, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir, I'd like one for these children
here, if you please. All of them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure that's alright, miss?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. It's better to eat
with everyone, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, here you go. I'm
treating you to Softy Kreem.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey now, don't push! There's
enough for everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a nice person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha, where're you seeing that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You sure a rich lady like that isn't
just trying to bask in her sense of
superiority?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should go back soon. The
Softy Kreem is gonna melt.

[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, kids. Make sure you're
living for the day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
How charitous. It must feel
good to give to the poor.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think of it as charity.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't think that money can buy
everything, <Ilene> <Rembrandt>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You even want the people of Fitzgald
to sell their souls to you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> <Rembrandt>? <Stahn>,
that name is definitely...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I've explained the principles
of Oberon Company many times.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're investing our funds with
the hopes of developing Fitzgald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You newcomers are just trying to turn
a profit. The people who've been here
since the beginning are still poor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's... surely we're...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. What do you people from
Seinegald know about Fitzgald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is of no concern to outsiders.
So hurry up and leave our country!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's... isn't that wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not good to judge people
based on their birth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's it to you, kid? Are
you trying to preach to me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... Isn't it better
not to interfere?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Th-this is?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
My, who is this lovely
glasses maiden?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who? M-me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
My heart is racing? 
You're my ideal woman!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shall we have energy drinks together?
Or perhaps do Hindu squats!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well that's an exciting pickup line.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
His personality changed
all of a sudden...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah?Uh, that's, um, I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cut it out, You're scaring <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're interfering, boy. Who are
you to this beauty, anyway?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia> is my friend.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that  you and I
are destined to battle!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
A duel! C'mon, to my arena!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why do we have to duel?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you do not have to play
along. We don't have time for games.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you lost your nerve, boy?
Is that sword hanging at your
waist too dull?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did you say, you insolent?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are truly a man, you will accept
my duel! IF you are a true man!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, ...I'll do it if it
means that much to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll make you regret insulting me.
<Stahn>, let's give him hell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, make sure to watch this.
I will meet with you after my victory!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>... If you won't stop
him, what are we going to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh... but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do whatever you like? It
doesn't really concern me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, <Stahn>.
Because of me, you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not really your fault, <Philia>.
It was a decision I made by myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, where is the arena anyway?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you go up the main street in
town to the north, there's an
entrance at the end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. I'll go now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My Softy Kreem...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Oh. It melted.

Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
