[ENDBLOCK]
Dead...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Draconis, launch!
Target, Dycroft!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well done, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've done what you wanted.
Now let <Marian> go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell me something. Once I release
<Marian>, what will you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...? What do you-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've stolen a top military
secret, and killed a fellow
soldier, on top of that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have nowhere
to go now, hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut up! That's
because of you...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, I can't help but
pity you, you poor child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Go ahead, strike me down.
I won't stop you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
By all means, kill me.
However, <Marian> will
forever be outside your reach...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well? What are
you waiting for? Go ahead.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pathetic. And after your big talk
about being your own man, too...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll get right to the point,
you're next assignment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
My next assignment?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to take back
the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni...impossible!
What are you scheming??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once you have secured the Eye,
you will use that to contact me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Secure the Eye...you can't be serious!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm deadly serious. It is up to you
whether or not you believe me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There. You have what you wanted.
Now release <Marian>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think of
this world as it is, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't change
the subject!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Answer the question.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now...?
...Nightmarish.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes! This is a nightmare.
One you can never awaken from!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying there's
still more you want from me?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem able to make the right
choices, even in your darkest dreams.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Your nightmare has
only just begun.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
