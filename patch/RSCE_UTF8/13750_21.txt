[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it was you, mister!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh...? Did you know we were coming?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'see, I'm always watching
from the window upstairs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though it's all dark out?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Sweetie, please stay upstairs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Whaaat, but  why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I asked you to.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...You all know, don't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...That my husband didn't make
it when the Draconis crashed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You don't know that for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no hope left anymore...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The world is the way it is, and
my husband isn't coming home...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything will be okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your husband will definitely come back.
And we'll fix the world for sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
You're very kind and strong...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just leave everything to us!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
But...you're also a liar.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not...
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! I know you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
You're on an adventure
to save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aha, it's kinda weird
hearing it put like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'see, I'm always watching
from the window upstairs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
I watched you guys
come from the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were watching even
though it's all dark out?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Sweetie, please stay upstairs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Whaaat, but  why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I asked you to.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...It was you all.

[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...My husband belonged to
the Draconis's crew.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Which means...

[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...I've heard.
That you were aboard the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no hope left anymore...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The world is the way it is, and
my husband isn't coming home...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything will be okay.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whether we were there or not,
things would've turned out the same.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
He sits up there at the window
every day, waiting for his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
If he spots anyone that looks
even slightly like him, he
comes running down here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
"Mom look! Dad's back!"
he'll tell me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then you should...
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Mom look! Dad's back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Sweetie, I want you
to please listen to me...

[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's dad!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, just listen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
No, dad came back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Your father is...
He's no longer...
[ENDBLOCK]
Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa there, you're not gonna say I'm
no longer with the living, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Yaaay! Welcome home, dad!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
You were alive...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Course I was. It's my duty
to keep you both happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The boy misses his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
My husband has been away
at work for some time now.
I'm getting a little worried.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been asking the military
about my husband, they won't
tell me anything...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Even in a world like this, I feel
I can make it if I have a family.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please do your best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please do your best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Please Dad, I'm tired of
waiting for you to come home!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
My father hasn't come home for
a long time. What's wrong with him?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, where's Dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm happy you're here, Daddy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
