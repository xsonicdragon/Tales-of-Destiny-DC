[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hahaha.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just a housewife's chat...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you. I haven't seen your face
around here, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm from the city of
Cyril in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, this is
your husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, am I !?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, my husband is
in Cyril.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right,
I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, don't worry. What are you
talking about here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
It's already decided for the aunts'
well-end meeting!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now, I'm talking about
General <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a little scary, isn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's true that some people
do think that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
But he's a very popular person
in Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That man?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Even though he is a
civilian employee, he is the one
who thinks about safety and
happiness first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a surprising fact. The next
time we meet, We'll make fun of
this story.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Making fun of me, <Mary>...
Are you <Rutee> now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to say to our customers,
but we are not currently
cashing lenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, why?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, this will run out of Gald.
[ENDBLOCK]

ask why!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to say to our customers,

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, we... that, I have to get
rid of my debt by tomorrow...
do I have to?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do
with the question?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to get rid of our
debt right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Otherwise, there may not
be a tomorrow
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you say so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I knew that I couldn't cash
it, so please tell me the reason.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
You can see it by going to the
house of General Oberon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s House?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!

I don't really like Mr. Hugo. He's handsome

something "off" about him...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It's peaceful today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Dryden> is a wonderful man.
I will not allow anyone to deny it.

[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell? I'm pretty
sure that voice is...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, do you know my grandfather? 
he used to hang around here.

He just suddenly went somewhere.
I hope he's alright...

[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I was stung by

Wahh! it's <Lion>! Wahhh!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Hey mama. Let's go on a picnic
on your next day off.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The number of <Lion>'s fans has
increased recently, but I was the
one who fell in love with him first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey mama. Let's go on a picnic
on your next day off.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a lot of soldiers
in the city. I wonder why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish <Lion> could beat
all the bad guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I went to the castle and left the
lens. I was also helpful, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Lion>? I was just
talking about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you <Lion>? Wow, you're
a beautiful guy even up close!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! I heard you've achieved
your great mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my, I can't believe you're
talking to me <Lion>. You're
really a cutie you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw the rumored <Lion> the other day.
He's such a pretty boy, I'm in love with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard a rumor from a soldier that <Lion>
has fulfilled another great mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen <Lion> lately, I wonder 
if he's gone somewhere far away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> where have you run off
to at such a terrible time?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
There are rumors that <Lion> was
a bad guy, but I don't believe them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Make a hole in that
damn outer shell!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you dare lose!

[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I hope you'll rise to the occasion.
It's not the era of the Seven Generals anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll dry
my futon today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I think <Lion> will be elected
for the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I hope you'll rise to the occasion.
It's not the era of the Seven Generals anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll dry

[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The castle seems to
be in a state of unrest.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The voice that came from the sky,
it sounded familiar somehow?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that it was Oberon's CEO
who was broadcasting from the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what will happen
to Seinegald now...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please make the world
go back to normal.

Rumor has it that the Draconis

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

I'm bored out of my mind.

[ENDBLOCK]
There's a rumor that the two countries

[ENDBLOCK]
Everywhere you go in town these days,
people are talking about <Lion> Magnus.

[ENDBLOCK]

will freeze in the blink of an eye...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I hear they're building a secret weapon
in the castle to breach the outer shell.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Damn, why... When I saw that
light, tears came out.

Even so, I'm still flesh and blood.
There's a limit to what I can endure.
[ENDBLOCK]

You're still the champion, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, that's far enough, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps Seinegald isn't the only 
one in this situation right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Castles and cities all over the world 
would be under attack by the same 
kind of monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not just <Rutee>. We're all worried 
about our families and our hometowns.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, here we are, fighting.
I don't have to tell you any more 
than that, do I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, <Kongman>.
I was a little frustrated.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay. If you think about it, 
you're a Fitzgardian, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come to think of it, I hadn't really 
thought about Lienea's village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, come on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not that I forgot. It's natural 
to be worried and concerned.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know... 
more like...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that's good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now we have to figure out 
how to get up there, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to defeat <Miktran> and 
get the Eye of Atamoni back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
.....
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like things have settled
down for the moment. Thank you

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't we take a short

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I agree. I need to 
rest while we can.
[ENDBLOCK]
I will inform His Majesty 
about all of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, let's head to 
the inn, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you hear me, <Miktran>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must feel pretty good looking 
down at the earth from up there!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's only for now!
We'll never give up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter how many years 
it takes, no matter how hard
it is, we will get there!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The strength of man on earth,
living as firmly as a plant with
roots in the ground!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm gonna make you pay for this!
I'll make sure of it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Sorry, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know if it's because
I'm not very smart, but I'm not 
a good listener.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So no matter how much they say 
it's impossible, I can't agree.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Appalling, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We feel the same way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm-hm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have to tell you that now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what I'm saying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I get it. Why I didn't 
think much of Lienea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
For me, Lienea and everything else.
I'm not sure how to say it, but I'm 
going to say it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to protect it.
I want to protect this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to protect this world, 
where the people I love are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>, let me know 
how you really feel.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not a military decision. It's about
what you think for yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You may look like a sword, but you're
still a person, just like us, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you want to do 
about the situation?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have to tell you that. Of course
I want to do something about it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The land we struggled to reclaim a 
thousand years ago cannot be taken 
from us so easily!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's think about it together.
We'll do everything we can.
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
