[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? I believe you are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. You're the one that 
defeated <Lilith> in the arena?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
And there it is!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Don't talk to 
me like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it? Eh, uh~...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay to talk about <Lilith>,
you can talk about her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the one. I thought I'd
give you some good information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Didn't we once have a pirate
invasion of this city?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you mean <Batista>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
One of them is a sunken pirate ship.
in this area of the ocean.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's also possible that some
treasure had sunk with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you don't want to share
such valuable information with me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's at the bottom of the sea,
anyway. I'll never get there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Lilith>, say thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish I was stronger.
I can't do it, can I?
[ENDBLOCK]
Begin creating the ocean.

[ENDBLOCK]
The city's opinion of
Oberon is controversial.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a long-time resident, but I think 
it's good for the city to develop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I think that Ms. <Ilene> is fine with
evacuating the residents without
taking their own risks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Has <Ilene> gotten over this city?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald has sent a large number
of soldiers to the damaged area.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
But the government of this country
doesn't do anything in this situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
The government doesn't do anything,
even though we don't know when the
city will be attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Rather than waiting for the powers
that be, I was thinking of doing
what I could.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't much, But I
gave what lens I could.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know why that barbarian
<Kongman> or whatever, is so popular.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> took out a fleet of armed
ships? Hmmm, can't get it out of my head.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, are you going somewhere?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Where's <Kongman> going to go?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> is the hero of this city,
right? Then protect this city!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, I was wrong. I'm sorry
for being so selfish.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck in your quest to save
the world. Mighty! Mighty! Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Go for it! <Kongman>！
Mighty! Mighty!

Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
People who are satisfied with material
things are not necessarily mentally
satisfied as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
What this city needs most right now,
is a Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish we had a temple in this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
It is at times like this that we
should spread the teachings of
Atamoni to the people of the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this another test
that Atamoni has given us...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni will surely be a guide
on your path ahead.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
So this is Neuestadt... the city
at the heart of Fitzgald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My hometown, Lienea,
is also here in Fitzgald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not my only motivation...
but we've gotta find <Greybum> soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, we're going to <Ilene>'s estate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> is the head of Oberon Corp.
in the Fitzgald region.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'd be a good idea to make
use of her influence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We need a ship. We're going to
strike back at that armada.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait! I'm going with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to protect our town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> is doing her best, too. I'm
not going to let her out-do me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's fight together!
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
When you're ready, just give me
a shout, and we'll set sail!
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a considerable amount of
enemy ships. As soon as we leave
port, we'll attack!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bring 'em on! I'll smash every
last one of 'em to bits!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our goal is the flagship. We don't have
enough time to do a thorough search.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, we have to put an end
to this, and fast. Get us to
the biggest ship out there!
[ENDBLOCK]
It's gonna be a bit rough,
so hold on tight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for the
warm welcome, folks!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Champion, <Kongman> has
crushed the evil armada, and
brought peace back to the town!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Mighty!	Mighty!	Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Mighty!	Mighty!	Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...It's not like he did
it all by himself...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sick of all this noise.
Let's head back to <Ilene>'s estate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just remembered something I need
to do. Go on ahead without me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmmm. <Stahn> looks pretty
worried about <Ilene>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if he likes
older women...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, are you...disappointed?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-not at all! I would never. 
It's impossible. Completely out
of the question!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you really shot that down 
with everything you've got.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmmm...What was with that ship?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
When you all were fighting 
out at sea, a ship from the
armada came this way...
[ENDBLOCK]
But then it left almost right away.
So what the heck was that about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
A ship...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you get close to Aquaveil,
please use a rowboat to get to land.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for taking
care of us, <Ilene>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh... <Philia>, you're
really going, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I weren't helping to rebuild the
town, I would come along with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'll be okay. You're needed
here in town, <Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, how are you so kind!!
What an inspiration!! Uwahhhhh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a nice interpretation.
That's good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! Please protect
<Philia> properly in my place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If anything happens to <Philia>,
I will destroy you!!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry, it'll be fine.
Leave everything to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, we're leaving now.
Really, thank you so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, don't forget about our
challenge from earlier, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't forget. Who'll realize
their ideal first, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope we'll have some results
the next time we meet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ideals, huh...wonder if that's
something easier said than done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, take care!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's get on the ship.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hey, <Kongman>!
You been well?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the champion!
Of course I've been well!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going to Phandaria,
right? I'm coming with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the champion, though.
Is it OK for you to leave the city?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'll be fine! Besides,
I'm worried about you guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you feel that way, but
please don't take it too hard. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to hide
your feelings for me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Feelings...? What??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, I'm coming with you!
I've already decided!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well OK, <Kongman>!
We'll be counting on you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Leave everything to me!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!

At this rate, the town will be so full of
people, we'll be packed like sardines
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
On top of that, all they do is complain
and make noise...I'm utterly sick of it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you!
Stop whining!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! This town's full enough as it is,
go back to your own country!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
What a barbarous race of
people! It makes me sick!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case,
you might as well leave!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
f you think that, then maybe
you should leave too!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT! It's because of people like
you that this city will never advance!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
HEY! Cut it out, all of you! 
What's come over you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You stay out of this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everybody, calm down! What
would <Ilene> think of this??
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Didn't <Ilene> flee long ago? 
She was all talk, nothing more
than an idealist.
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You're wrong.
She was completely deluded.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did you say?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, cut it out.
What'll we do if you lose your cool?
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't kid around. Whatever <Ilene>
claimed to do for this city, there's
nothing to show for it at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thats...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true at all!
Miss <Ilene> taught us a lot!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Adults, both the rich and the poor,
only care about themselves!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
But we're different.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Some way or another,
we will find a way to change this city!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, everyone! Are you
really going to let the kids leave
you in the dust like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I reckon we can't
say they're wrong!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It's..definitely pathetic to be
called out like this by kids..
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. That's right!
We should all work to make
this town the best it can be!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>... Looks like you've pulled
ahead of me in our little wager.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
More than ever, arguments
are breaking out.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't there a Town
Hero around?<x00>
