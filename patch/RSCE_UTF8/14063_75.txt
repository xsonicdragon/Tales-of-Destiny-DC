My dad...he never says

[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so mean!
You don't know a thing about-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course I don't.
How would I know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't understand
your own father, yet
you expect me to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, he's just a kid, you shou-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, be quiet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a total stranger to you,
even though he's your father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
B-but father doesn't...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If he won't change, then
it's up to you to change
your own way of thinking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes...That's the
right thing to do...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I...I don't
understand at all!!

Hey, let's go.

Hey, do you like your dad?

[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, if I thought as
an adult myself.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Even my father's stubbornness
is starting to look kind of cute.

[ENDBLOCK]
He's not here right now, but 
I'm sure he'd love to hear
what you just said.

Well, it's more than 96 times now.

Hone your ability a bit more then
come back and speak with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, this is Shiden? The buildings
are all so different.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp, should we go look
for the Oberon branch
here, like in Calvalese?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There isn't one here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Remember? Aquaveil has a
policy of National Isolation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Incidentally, there's no
Straylize Temple here, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, what do we do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary> and I will hang around and
try to scout out some information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys lay low in this area.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you be okay if
it's just you two?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be okay because it's just us
two. We'll be too conspicuous if
we all try to go together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>'s not back yet...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius> carried out the military
suppression of Moreau?
[ENDBLOCK]
The Moreau port has been blockaded.
Business is going to plummet because
of that.
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems <Tiberius> called in an
outsider as his military advisor.
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard about that. His name
was Grey... something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shh! Be quiet!
[ENDBLOCK]
There are also rumors that the third
prince is heading toward Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't he just sightseeing as usual?
That helpless libertine.
[ENDBLOCK]
He used to be a sensible person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's possible that we've obtained
the information we wanted.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So <Greybum> isn't here. We should
go check out Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
But how...? If the ports are
closed, we can't use a ship.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mysterious Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Two men, one woman. You
lot must be the backup.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Please go to Moreau at once. I will
also contact the young Prince.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Umm, aren't you mistaking
us for someone else?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, we are the backup. What's
the best way to get to Moreau?
[ENDBLOCK]
You can use the sea cave. 
There's an entrance to it 
to the south of town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
The floor of the cavern is very
brittle. Please be cautious.
[ENDBLOCK]
There are terrible monsters living
there, as well. Try not to linger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're just going to
lie to him like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's the one who made
such a careless mistake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're back. We heard some things
from the townspeople. It seems 
like <Greybum> is in Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, apparently Moreau's
under military suppression.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, we heard that too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-well, do you know about the 
Prince? He's in Moreau right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, we know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Mary>. I feel like screaming
at the top of my lungs right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll follow your lead.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should head for that sea cave.
The entrance is south of town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Look anywhere there might be
some rope. Leave no stone unturned.
[ENDBLOCK]

Don't dawdle, you two!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
