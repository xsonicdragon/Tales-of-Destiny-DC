[ENDBLOCK]
Brother, wake up!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm...

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Heyyy, I said wake up!!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw...<Lilith>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not <Lilith> dummy! I can't
believe I have to be the one
to wake you up.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh...I'm so glad...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it? Did you have
a scary dream?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't just scary, it was super scary!
I was drowning? I thought I was gonna die!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But then I heard a weird voice.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wake up, <Stahn>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah yeah, just like tha... 
wait what?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
How long are you going to sleep?
It's time to get up.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uwah...?!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where am I...?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, right! I escaped from
the Draconis!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I took this sword... now that I
look at it, it seems kinda old-fashioned.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
How vexing that you'd call me
old-fashioned.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh...?!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heyy! Don't make so much noise.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The sword! The sword is talking!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course I am. I am alive, after all.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way, normal swords aren't alive!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get a hold of yourself.
I am a Swordian.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorty..in...?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
A thousand years ago, a sword with
a soul was forged. That sword is me.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you get it now? Now hurry and
pick me up. You've been neglecting
me on the floor this whole time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ooh, right.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Goodness...You're not even capable
of keeping calm, are you?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are to be my master, please try
being a little more level-headed.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you just say master?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You did forge a pact with me, didn't you?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you remember what happened
at the bottom of the lake?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Ah!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you were the one that I
was hearing. Weren't you?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said your name was <Dymlos>?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is correct.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
At that moment, when you called my
name, our pact was sealed.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
And now you are my master.
A Swordian Master.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A Swordian...Master...

[ENDBLOCK]
?????
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems you've come to.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you are...?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Woodrow>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm. You seem to looking better now.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I found you collapsed at the bottom
of the lake, I had no idea what to do.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you're the one who carried me here?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
They call me <Stahn> Aileron.
Thanks a bunch for saving me!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So um... where are we?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Deep in the mountains of Phandaria.
Did you not realize that?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was hitching a ride on the Draconis,
but then I had to escape from it, so...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Draconis? I see...
Then, what about that sword?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know about it?
This thing can talk!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! Don't talk about me so
carelessly to other people!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean? Why not?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Only those who possess the aptitude of a
Swordian Master can hear my voice.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you talk to me around people
who can't hear me, they might think
you're crazy or something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? O-okay...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, no. Don't...
worry about it.

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>! Hey! (you little)... You went
to the mountain again!

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. I see you're awake, boy.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is my bowmaster, Alba.
This cabin belongs to him.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, thank you for helping me.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should help one another
out when we're in need.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is Master
Alba's granddaughter.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master, I'll go out back
and look for her.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohh, you'd do that for me?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go, too, as thanks for helping me.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure. Then let's go together.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'll leave it in your hands.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
