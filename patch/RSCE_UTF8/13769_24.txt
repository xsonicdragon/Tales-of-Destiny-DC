What happened here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Currently on a mission,
Mr. <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well well. How about that?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Just as you would 
have it, <Lewein>...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn> Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so. My name is
<Lewein>. Nicholas <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am one of the Seven 
Generals of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Lewein>,
thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, nice to meet you.
<Stahn> Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aileron? Is it possible you are
related to Thomas Aileron...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know Thomas?
That's my grandpa.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so! I'm surprised to
see his grandson here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That? Maybe the officer who
helped Meji-chan...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
That? Maybe the officer
who helped me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was a child, he would
tell me the story of when he
helped you all the time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, 
how is your grandmother?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, General. We're in
a hurry to get a jump on our mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Sorry
about that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need to send Thomas a letter.
I hope to talk again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take this with you. I'm sure
you'll make use of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll make a trip to
see Thomas soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, hurry up.
Aren't you on an 
important mission?

Aww, it's nothing.

The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk

interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,

Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
