The garden is soothing.
It helps me feel relaxed, which lets
me concentrate on security.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It's all thanks to Master <Lion>
that the Draconis is back.

[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we been deceived by
<Lion> and <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>...
Is that the name of the mastermind?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The Lens Cannon is mankind's trump
card. We must protect it at all costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sunlight is a beautiful thing...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The castle is amazing, but it
does have some weaknesses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, there's no way in hell that 
this place is going to be breached.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, the Empress has not been
seen. It seems she is in poor health.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Well, there's no way in hell that

[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> was able to take the Draconis
because we were overconfident in
our security.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Our responsibility is too heavy.
What should we do...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon's CEO <Hugo> broadcasted that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are headed to <Reynolds>' lab,
take the door on the left.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that the barrel of Belcrant's
gun fell into the sea?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Until the Lens Cannon is complete,
I'll protect this place at all costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of the world for me, alright?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Dryden's uncle played
with me the other day.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The people at the castle
have been on edge lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Why did this war start?
How can we end it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
We shouldn't go out cause it's
dangerous outside the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he would gather all the
lens in the world in this garden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, there's a hole in the sky!
A hole！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon
will be built here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon will be
finished soon. Please procure the lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon is complete.
All that's left is to carry out the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll never forget what you taught
me, commander.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please, for the sake of the commander,
make sure you defeat <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Reynolds> is currently
unavailable for visitors.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
But don't worry, our country's elite
researchers are here to help you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe in your victory,
Swordian Team.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've done all we can. Please
handle the rest, my friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>, we've
retrieved the lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for your help！
Sorry for all the trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm, looks like we've made a lot
of progress on the Lens Cannon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, it's finished.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? That's great!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd really prefer to increase the
efficiency of the energy conversion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
That way, we could increase
the energy output.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is what we have not enough?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. Everyone has
been collecting lens for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure we can shoot
through the outer shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, does it matter where
in the outer shell you shoot it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I've already decided where to aim.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll let you know when 
we start the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm looking
forward to it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let us report back
to His Majesty once more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fun, huh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's here. Preparations for the Integrated
Lens Cannon are well underway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just received a report that repairs
for the Draconis have finished.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can fly at anytime.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are now entering the final
sequence for the firing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Setting Integrated Lens Cannon sights.
Target: Radisrol.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why aim at Radisrol?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why would you do that,
<Reynolds>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take a good look at the hull.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
See those blue hemisphere things?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. What is that thing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're Energy Absorbers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way. So that means...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
They'll absorb the energy when the
Lens Cannon hits the outer shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
However...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The visible parts of Radisrol are
unaffected by the absorbers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, the more reliable way
is to shoot through that area.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But what if <Ritora> is still alive?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Radisrol is still around,
so it's possible, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, he wouldn't be unharmed.
The entire core crystal would blow up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That would definitely
means death for <Ritora>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No！
Isn't there another way!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If there was one, I'd choose it.
I don't like this either!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's why I wanted to increase the power
output. I wanted to aim anywhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, given the cannon's durability,
we were at our limit...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't blame yourself, <Reynolds>.
You've done well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're still alive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I managed to restore the communication function.
Still, the situation is pretty precarious...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian team, 
don't hold back!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the solution I came up with after
analyzing all the information I had.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The future of the world rests in your hands.
Don't hesitate to do what you have to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
......
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, 
carry out <Ritora>'s wishes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I understand, 
Mr. Reynolds, I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, please announce 
the launch of the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the fate of the world at stake,
we will now launch our final operation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Integrated Lens Cannon, 
prepare to fire!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Energy charge rate at 80%.
Integrated lens circuit connection online.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Generator pressure rising.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Prepare to fire the Integrated Lens Cannon. 
All personnel, put on anti-shock and flash protection.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The final countdown starts.	
	

[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Integrated Lens Cannon, FIRE!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's... our beacon of hope.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, <Ritora> this light will never replace
the shinning beacon that you were.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to make that light bigger 
and everlasting by our own hands.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, let's get to Dycroft. 
It's the final battle!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ooh!

Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

up one you like, so you can set it on
