<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think I'm in the mood for
a straightforward approach.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Johnny>. What are
you doing out here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah, it's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a very curious
thing to say!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, spit it out.
You'll feel better.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha. She's such
a straightforward girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm... now... This is where
it happened, here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a long time ago... Don't
stay long. Come on, let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that looks like it
was around here...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If she saw that, she'd be...
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sure what to say.
Let's talk about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell? Is there
someone up there?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh! In times like this,
close your eyes and listen
with your mind's eye.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Now! Open your eyes!
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
...But ...<Johnny>'s...
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter. This is between you and 
me. It's yours.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
(Sounds like a man and
a woman.) Could this be the
scene of an encounter?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Lucky!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
And more. 
Gather!	Gather!
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
I like it!
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad... also...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? What's
that voice?
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
You like me too, don't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
... Oh. But I'll keep quiet
about it for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
..., please.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like an idiot. I'm such a...
This is just like...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
... Clown.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this a thought trapped
in the lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, shit!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can I help you,
Your Majesty the Great?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who the hell are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's just say that I'm
here to help you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you really think that
calling me Majesty the Great
will make me accept it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it is not. In fact,
you will be a great king.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Now,
please be aware.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, let's dethrone the 
Great King of Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
The reason is that he is accused
of giving the national treasure 
sword to Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
But there's no evidence. That's
not going to convince the people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is nothing to worry about.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
The boy with the treasure
sword will be here soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
And when you become the Great
King, you will loudly proclaim
the overthrow of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't make it easy for me, 
Shiden has <Johnny> and 
Moreau has <Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about that. My associate
has already taken care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's time for you to rise to the top,
after losing your beloved and having
been treated poorly by the other
nations. Your Majesty the Great.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... "YOU" will be the 
Great King of Aquaveil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've fallen for
an obvious trick.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius> was used 
or some reason, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, the
guy is... Oh well.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
