The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].

notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople

interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,

Something fun may happen.

That's a girl, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell?	Say that
again. See what happens...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, are you from Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Then do you know a swordsman
by the name of <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I've only seen your face
from a distance once.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a very handsome swordsman,
and I adore him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
She has such a small body, yet she's
so graceful on  the battlefield 
with all those strong men in tow.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why I call you Sir, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It's called "The Rose of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the same woman.
If you're Sir, <Lion>.

You are...

<TAG_007>It's been a while.
Let's see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. By the way, <Mary>?
I heard you had lost your memory.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'd forgotten all about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. You're
really funny, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to visit Cyriil next time.
I want to see <Dalis>'s face, again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm looking forward to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
You're still a bit of a jerk,
aren't you, <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
How are things going
with you and <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh!	You are!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Who? I hope it's not
some kind of blur.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are the lady who lived next door
to <Dalis> as a child, and who took
good care of the young <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you remember me well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, okay. A wife like you is just
fine for a hard man like <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope you can get along with
<Dalis> and let your auntie
carry your child soon.

<TAG_007>Ma'am, what about me?
I'm in private now. You can sign later.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm uncomfortable
when you're naked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's ridiculous. There's no 
such thing as a woman like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm here. I'm here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha.
There's no such thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
So I'll sign it later.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you. Why are
you naked ......?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Your people don't say anything?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha.
Who wouldn't want to see
these muscles of mine!
