[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, I've realized something
here, if you don't mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe we should step on two of 
those pedestals at the same time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's split up here and give it a go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I get it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe two of those pedestals 
should be on at the same time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, let's just do it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, I have an idea, 
if you don't mind.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is one possibility, but wouldn't
they stand on those two pedestals at
the same time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sure, but I think it's worth a try.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think the key to solving this
mystery lies in the fact that 
there are two pedestals.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
How about standing on both 
of them at the same time?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, let's do what we can.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guys, can I have one thing?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is just my hunch, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't we try to get on two 
pedestals at the same time?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
The trap that <Rutee> was trapped
in before also had a switch that was
pressed at the same time.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's do it anyway.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, I'll tell you what I think.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps, though, you could try
standing on the two pedestals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
If something happens to it,
it's a "win-win" situation.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What?
What's the difference...?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
I get it!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>.
I've noticed.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
After thinking about it, 
I've come to the conclusion...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It means getting on both 
pedestals at the same time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps we can move on now.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Philia>, you're with me.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! The rest of you, get off 
your arses and get going!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got an idea, 
if you don't mind.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Earlier, when I was on that pedestal, 
the other side was glowing too, right?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, why don't we get to the other
side and step the pedestals at the
same time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's just try it.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
