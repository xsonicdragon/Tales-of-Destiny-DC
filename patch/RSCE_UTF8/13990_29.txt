<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...why are you here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>, I was worried about you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were? 
Thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
The cherry blossoms are beautiful,
aren't they? They don't seem to 
have any worries.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong? Is something
bothering you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... something bothering me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Like... if you're thinking the
attack on the town was your 
responsibility or something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I wouldn't think something
like that, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's more, whether I could have 
handled it better. Aiding the injured,
the evacuation of the people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>, you did as much as
you could. You even injured
yourself in the process.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I have to face
all of the townspeople.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>. Why can't we rid the
world from the conflict and fighting?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not just the armada, either.
There's even conflict between
the people here in town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's, well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to make a place where 
everyone can smile, and where
no one hates each other.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
But I wonder if those aren't 
just the vain ideals of an 
ignorant child...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aren't ideals a good thing to have though?
If you don't have any, then you won't be
able to change anything for the better.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as you have a clear goal,
then I think that's great, <Ilene>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any ideals, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I left my hometown to become
a knight of Seinegald, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's different from an ideal
though. My ideals are... um...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want my family to
be happy... maybe?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right. Thinking
about it now, that's why I 
want to become a knight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand that now
because of you, <Ilene>.
Thank you very much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
How strange. Just by talking
with you, <Stahn>, somehow I 
feel better.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's good to hear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Make your family happy, hm? Our 
ideals are surprisingly similar.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, do you want to
have a competition? To see who can
achieve their goals first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine, I accept your challenge.
What do you think, is ten years
too soon to beat me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not gonna lose!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe... we should probably head
back. Shall we go to my house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
