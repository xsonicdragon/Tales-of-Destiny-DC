We don't know what's ahead of us.
The more forces you have, the better.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand, Lord <Woodrow>
If you say so...

I'll stay. <Stahn> and the

Thank you for waiting,

Thanks for your help, <Stahn> and

[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's this! No thanks needed.
It was nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you're everything's okay.
Now, let's get going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Were you lonely just because 
I wasn't there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha, no way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, be careful.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys take care of 
<Chelsea> for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm fine. Take care 
of yourselves.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this the site where 
the R key is located?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know there was such 
a place near Lienea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't get here without coming
from the sea. It's no wonder you 
didn't notice it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay! Wait for me, Lion. I'll get 
vengeance on your enemies.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...about that, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't think too much 
about <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You want me to forget him?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wouldn't say that. But you're too
wrapped up in your personal grudge
right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must never lose sight of the 
cause for which you are fighting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know, I know. We need to defeat 
<Hugo> and get the Eye of Atamoni
back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's true, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay. I haven't 
forgotten anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's go, everyone!
We're searching for the R key!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you're on fire!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, yeah ♪
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>. what is it with you and 
staring at <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a dead end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't panic. Look over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The ruins are sealed in such a
way that you cannot proceed 
without a special key.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
The key is, of course, us, 
the Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean, we could put one
of us in there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The seal will only be broken 
while we are embedded into it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That means we have to leave 
a Swordian behind, don't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not comfortable leaving
my Swordian alone. I'd rather 
stay with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
People of the earth!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Accept our gift! Another 
blast from Belcrant!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's two shots down.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
The energy is being replenished
faster than expected. At this rate,
the third shot will be coming soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...We need to hurry
back to Radisrol.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
