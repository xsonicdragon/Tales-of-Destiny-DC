Researcher 
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you're the ones in command
of the Draconis, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, We are, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a zoologist. I have 
a favor to ask you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, what can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm trying to find out how this 
sky-covered earth is affecting 
the ecosystem.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eee...co-system?
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, well... don't worry your head 
about the details.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
What I want to find out is:
"The number of birds that 
are still out flying around"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You want me to use the Draconis
to count? Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Correct. Well, Could you help me?
<TAG_007>Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that's a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you help count birds?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that's a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, well, thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
I've written down the research methods
here. Please read it carefully.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
Count the number of birds flying in the
sky around the world. You'll need to get
on the Avitus Draconis, first.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
The way to count the number of
birds is simple. When you see a 
bird, follow it for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
If you follow a bird for a certain 
amount of time, you'll lock on to it.
That means you've counted that bird.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
When doing so, the distance between
the bird and the Avitus Draconis is
important. Whenever possible, chase
the bird from directly behind.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
When you successfully lock on, the 
current research value will be 
displayed in the upper right corner
of the screen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
Please note that the same
bird will not count.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
Any flashing bird you find have yet
to be researched. Look for them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you understand everything?
If you want to hear it again or 
have finished your research 
please come and see me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher.
[ENDBLOCK]
I look forward to working with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
How's the research going?

Rumor about a giant bird 
Do nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep me posted.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I've been waiting for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
According to the research the number
of birds in the world is <x0E><x08><x00><x00><x80><x17><x71><x46><xDC><x80><x0E><x08><x00><x00><x40>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that was helpful.
Thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
I still need to do more research.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
When you have time, please 
continue collecting data.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
This is perfect! Our ecological
research is complete. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just a rumor from the residents,
but... I heard that a giant bird was
seen in two different places.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
One was above the islands north of
Lienea. The other over the islands
southeast of Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Both birds were flying at a higher altitude
and faster speed than normal birds.
It may be difficult to find them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! You're just in time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a bad feeling about 
this, young master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Same.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, I'm busy.Now then, 
if you'll excu-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, don't be like that!
There's nothing to fear!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, over here, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What even is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If this works, your will undergo 
an incredible transformation!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, hope you're ready!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here we go!! POWER ON!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
GAHHH!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okaay...annd...stop!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah...Hah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you okay?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Somehow, yeah. What about
you, Chal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Reynolds>,
just what was tha-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*Hic!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you... hiccupping??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-yeah, seems like it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*Hic! Hiccup!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woohoo! Success!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What do you me-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HIC!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This time, I've invented a machine
that gives you the hiccups!
I call it the "Hicculationalizer"!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
When someone's exposed to that light,
they can't stop hiccupping!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think?
I'm a genius, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'd better be able to
fix this, <Reynolds>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HICCUP!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't tell me you already
want to go back to
how you were!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lemme at least get some data
first! I wanna see how long it lasts.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You gotta be ki-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HUP*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'd better f-fix this
now or I-I'll...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HURK*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh fine! Put that away. I'm sure
I can fix you right up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurry up alrea-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HICC*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright. POWER ON!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, time to make some notes.
As expected, even the
mighty Hedge Knight...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...is absolutely adorable...
...when he's got the hiccups.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You! Try saying that aga-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HIC*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looking forward to working with
you on my next experiment, too!
[ENDBLOCK]

Hmph! No one in their right
mind would willingly do so!!

Welcome to my lab!
What can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Help me out again
sometime!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
How's your tiara doing?
Looking forward to your report.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to my lab!
What can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
How's your tiara doing?
Looking forward to your report.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, I'm so sorry 
for all the trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> I'm so glad you're okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any idea what's
going on up top right now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was desperate to get out of Radisrol.
That's as far as I got.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, I've invited you 
all here because...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you take a look at this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Blueprint for... Integrated
Lens Cannon?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Simply put, it's a device that releases
an energy shot using power collected
from the lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not as powerful as the Belclant,
but I think it can at least punch a 
hole in the outer shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure we can make this
with equipment and materials 
we have on Earth?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this <Ritora>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
While I was working as the <Ritora>'s
assistant. I've been taking notes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I got a lot of advice 
from the commander.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's great <Reynolds>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was so frustrated that I kept 
getting shown up by you guys. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw Belcrant blast. I thought I'd 
make something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's show <Miktran> what the earth 
dwellers are really made of!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't there anything we can do?
I'll do anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The hope is...
That he's still there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I'd like to give you all the details
of the final operation the commander
had devised. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Final operation?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we use the Lens Cannon to punch
a hole in the outer shell. It's not the
end of the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to ask you all to
board Dycroft once again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I want you to defeat <Miktran>, 
the source of all this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's easy for you to say.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now, we don't even have
the means to get up there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that the broken 
Darconis can be repaired.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If there is a bio-metallic Bercerium.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bercerium is an extremely rare metal.
It's not that easy to find.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any idea 
where it might be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whatever it is, it's in 
Junkland in Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right. I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's an ancient industrial waste
deposit site. We can search there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can manage that, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if we could fix the Draconis, 
wouldn't it still be unable to reach
Dycroft's altitude?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've failed at that before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The weight of the completed outer
shell has also lowered the position
of the Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The current altitude of the Dycroft
is reachable, as long as the Draconis
is fixed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sure about the details, but it 
sounds like it could work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to start building the 
Lens Cannon right away. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd like to ask a couple favors
of the Swordian team. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
One is as I just said, 
repair the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
And more importantly...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enhance the Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enhacing is...
Can you do that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have a research facility
here on Earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean the Swordian R&D Lab?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
That place must have been buried 
in a cave-in after the last war.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does that research facility still exist?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've already checked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the aftermath of the Belcrant attack.
I heard that the facility was unearthed. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the heck...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the equipment in that facility. 
It's possible to enhance the Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enhancements, in the truest
sense of the word.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The real meaning, or...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's it for the operation briefing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
In spite of all this adversity. 
You continue to devise a plan
to break through the situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>, I'm impressed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what I call a ground
force commander.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You gave up on me. What are 
you so proud of?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
After hearing everything. we have 
to do it! Isn't that what we all want?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've been through some tough
times before. We'll beat the odds.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm coming with you guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll accompany you wherever you go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm-hm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have to tell you, do I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay! Let's head to the lab right away.
We need to reinforce the Swordians!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must warn you.
It's not so simple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you still talking like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just when I thought there was a 
glimmer of hope. You have to put 
a damper on things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you just said...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
"If you can't count on me. 
I need more training."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you lying to me 
when you say that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course not.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so rude!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
And the other three masters. 
Can I assume that the other three
masters are on the same page?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
 Mm-hm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's settled then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now we have to go
to the Swordian R&D Lab.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It means the time has come.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I could avoid coming. I might have.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>. What are you waiting for?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
"True Enhancement" is 
not just about us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
A sword is only as powerful 
as its wielder.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
In other words, enhancements 
must be done to the master at 
the same time. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you're saying we're supposed
to train? I'll do whatever you want!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not that simple.
It's a matter of life and death.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm-hm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the labs you're about to visit.
You'll encounter more obstacles
than ever before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The final trial to become a 
true Swordian Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The final... ordeal...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know I sound repetitive, but I'll 
ask it one more time.
<Stahn> Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to overcome the barriers 
that stand in my way. Do you desire
to be a true master?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course I do. No matter the 
obstacles. My resolve will not
change.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. I will work with
you until the end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is my responsibility. I chose 
you to be my partner.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente> 
[ENDBLOCK]
And you three, do you 
have any objections?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, a courier 
from our country!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's happened to our country?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, please come to

<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
