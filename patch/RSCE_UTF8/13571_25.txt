[ENDBLOCK]
Dead...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hang in there, Young Master!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing...I just wanted to
lie down for a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've had motion sickeness the
entire time we've been on
the Draconis, haven't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut up...
Leave me alone.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here, if I massage this part
of your wrist, you should
feel a little better.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
I guess I feel a bit better...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thought so.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way
I haven't thanked you, yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the cave near Shiden. When the
ground collapsed and <Stahn> and I fell in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because you did
something stupid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard at the time, you hurried
to get a rope
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia> told me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't tell you at the time.
But here's my thanks for that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was nothing to be thankful for.
It was for the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if that's how you feel.
I'm okay with that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, can I ask you something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you... have a home
to go back to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where's this coming
from, all of a sudden?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean exactly
what I asked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, my home
is an orphanage.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... so that's
where you're going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... That's funny.
Normally, people follow that up
with asking if I'm an orphan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
... Personally,
I couldn't care less.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, well, no
need to ask, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, it doesn't bother you?
Not knowing about your real family?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm curious, of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I do want to know what my
folks were like, or if I 
have a brother or sister.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh? I think we'll be arriving
at our destination soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, you know... I think of everyone 
in the orphanage is my family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm satisfied with that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, You were going to
say something earlier?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, we're about to arrive.
Our long mission is
finally over.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, don't ignore me. I know
you want to say something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were an orphan, huh? No wonder
you have such horrible manners...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sheesh...
You're such a jerk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't need you
to tell me that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>... There's
something I need to tell you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's about the true nature
of the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What am I going to do...?
I have to save <Marian>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>!
Please listen to me!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut up, Chal!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care about
the Eye of Atamoni!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it! We needed
to contact <Dymlos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Listen! The Eye of
Atamoni's true power is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So... that's
how it is, Chal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you said you'd
believe in me... was that a lie??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No! That's not what I...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal... Bite your tongue.
After all, you're still just a sword.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are nearing the facility where
the Eye of Atamoni was sealed!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
