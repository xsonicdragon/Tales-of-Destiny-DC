[ENDBLOCK]
I thought you said we

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't expect you to be an adult.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you want?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me ask you something. Did a kid
give you an instrument once?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I got an instrument
from a kid on a boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Actually, that
instrument was mine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd like to have it back
if you don't mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, I used to play
that instrument while I 
was picking up passengers.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then a customer who liked it very
much asked me to give it to him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
I got it as a gift. I thought
it was okay, so I gave it away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that the guy from Moreau?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
No... from Terazzi, I 
believe.  I think he said
he was here on business.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's getting a little interesting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> [ENDBLOCK
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go to Terazzi. Let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems there's been an
incident at that house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, there's been a bit
of an incident. One of my
soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, And they've been caught.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong with you?
You don't look so good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmm...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't tell me, <Fayte>. Did
this girl attack a soldier!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Fayte>!
I'm not the killer!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> Please believe me too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Surely such a small child. I can't
believe she attacked a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But then again...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
Such a girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear <Johnny>, Please help me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't help you if you
don't help me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, wait. can you
give us a moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Forgive me, but I have
to take this girl into custody.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, why don't you ask around
in the Moreau territory?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There might still be people
who know about the case.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident occurred yesterday 
morning. A soldier was attacked 
here in the Moreau territory.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, there have been a
number  of similar incidents
in the past few days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldier who was attacked
had two scratches on him.
[ENDBLOCK]
soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Based on the testimony of the 
attacked soldier and witnesses.
We arrived at that girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I have an
alibi that I saw the girl at
the time of the incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
I think that's why Master <Fayte> 
gave you all this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story. Would 
you like to hear a synopsis?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the death.
But he was playing with the 
cat at the time of the murder.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young man.
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoever's wearing Shiden outfits
here stands out. Besides. He's been
talking to the cat in a big voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
YOUNG MAN.
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you really talk to a cat?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
A girl, right? I was in here shopping
at the time of the incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd been wondering for a long time,
and when I thought he had made up
his mind and wrapped up the goods, 
he said he wanted something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
I remember it well because it 
happened over and over again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I was at the fish 
market in the harbor. I saw a girl 
who was making a lot of noise.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
I was kind of curious. I came
straight back to this inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
As soon as I returned, The boy who
was supposed to be at the harbor.
She came out of the house by 
the weapons shop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
There are no secret passageways
in this city. There should be no 
such thing as a secret passage. 
It's a wonder, really.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you find out who did it?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, please go inside and give
<Fayte> a debriefing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay... If you find the culprit.
Please come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
So, do you want to hear
about the case?
Yes
no

<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk

interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

<Chelsea>

<Rihanna>, you're the queen of

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I am.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, could I ask you 
something, I'd like to know
what you do as a queen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh?	Do you want to be
a queen, <Chelsea>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
No. I'm going to be a princess.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, first of all, a queen has
to work harder than she looks.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
First of all, when you wake
up  in the morning, you have
to get dressed right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't go out, looking like 
I just woke up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a bit of a bother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had time to practice, every day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, I don't like it either.
But it's easy enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
The best part is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so busy every day,
I'm indulging more and more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how much ...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>, do you not
like being queen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not all all, it makes me proud
to see my people happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I'm very happy to be on
the same path as my husband.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck to you too, <Chelsea>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I will be a great queen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>, you're the queen of
the Moreau territory, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I am, but a queen is 
a lot different from what
you imagine, <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's more of a struggle, and
it's given me more wrinkles.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>, you're beautiful,
so you'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you see. They say 
that beautiful women
have short lives.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there is 
anyone  who can destroy
this situation in the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll figure it out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if push comes to shove,
I'll ask for <Johnny>'s help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. You'll have to
work me then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, how
is <Johnny> doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
He doesn't tell me how
he really feels, so I can't
tell if he's tired or not.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, why is <Johnny>
acting like such a clown?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's <Mary>. I'll ask
you something that's
hard to hear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes... but first we need
to talk about <Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean <Fayte>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, <Fayte> used to have a 
girlfriend named <Eleanor>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you talk so calmly?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, <Johnny>, and <Eleanor>
are childhood friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> doesn't say it,
but I think he was in
love with <Eleanor>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
But <Eleanor> was
killed by <Tiberius>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> was so rough,
I can't imagine what he's
going through now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
And to <Johnny>, who encouraged 
<Fayte> at that time. <Fayte>
gave me a hard time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
And in the end, he said, "You, 
with your unrequited love You
will never understand my pain!".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a bit much, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It must have been a very painful
experience for you, too, <Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think he understands
that if  he talks like that,
<Johnny> will be hurt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But I had to say it...
It's because I was 
really suffering.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that incident, <Johnny>
seems to have changed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
He began to dress flamboyantly,
never stepping into another person's
mind, and never letting them into his.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> I still regret that, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why we'll do
whatever we can to help
make <Johnny> happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's kind of a surprising
past, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why <Johnny> seems
to be such a kind person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem like a nice person,
That's kind of a sad thing to say.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there's anyone
who can change the situation
of the world.<x00>
