Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been in and out of the
mansion, do you live here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen the President
of Oberon or the Steward of
the mansion in a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Oberon's headquarters.
Magnificent, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen the President
of Oberon or the Steward of
the mansion in a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahhhh! the mon...
the mountain is gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard the mastermind behind 
this is the President of Oberon?
You've got to be kidding me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If this was going to happen,
we should have shut down
Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The secret weapon they're building
at the castle uses a lot of lens,
right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
When I hear the word "lens",
I think of Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The secret lens weapon has nothing
to do with Oberon, does it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It has not been disclosed
that Master <Lion> is the 
son of this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Please be wary of
suspicious individuals.

[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Every time I hear about Master
<Lion>'s activities, I want to
brag about him to someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Hugo> is now an important
person in our country.
I'm here to protect him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been relieved of my duties
to guard the <Hugo> mansion.
My superiors told me
that I'm done.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, out of habit,
I'm still here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It was Mr. <Hugo> who was
playing that broadcast.
You can easily recognize
his voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
The crime of betraying our
country is serious.
I will never forgive <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I was ordered to watch over
the villa, so I'm still 
standing here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the mansion,
is waiting for someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think there's anyone who
would come back to this mansion now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the mansion,
is waiting for someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Nowadays, I can't imagine my
life without lens products.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
President <Hugo>'s achievements
are just too great.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I used to be a lens hunter too,
but Mr. <Rembrandt> picked me up.

Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A new world for the chosen ones.
I'd like to be taken there, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, the sky didn't pick me up.
Guess I didn't make the cut.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was a lens hunter,
I was always in danger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not scared by the fact that the sky
 is now covered with an outer shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, you greedy witch!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, guys!

Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning!

[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm still an apprentice, but I'm
looking forward to work with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh. I'm still an apprentice...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know? Master <Lion> is
in fact, this mansion's...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry!
It's nothing, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Chit chating is not allowed
in the house.
I feel suffocated every day.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a light falling from
far up in the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Such an amazing light, I've never
seen anything like it before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that the master and butler
are gone, this house is ruined.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I won't even get Paid
for all the work I've done...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> has returned.
She's changed her mood.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> told me to take the lens
to the Castle too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, I'm pumped up!
Let's hurry to Hayrise Temple!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's *Straylize*!
At least remember the name!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just remembered something.
Wait here a second.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That took too long!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright. Let's get moving.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not even gonna apologize
for making us wait for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have a Poison Charm?
You'll need them from here on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Chal. Explain it to them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can make jewels
with materials via Rerise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not only can they prevent ailments,
but they'll also increase your stats, 
and some carry other abilities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, you can repeatedly rerise a jewel,
thus increasing their effects on your stats.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So materials become jewels,
and you can strengthen them, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
See for yourself. Here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I did it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a good idea
to rerise materials often.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a moment, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I almost forgot to give you
your allowance. Here, take this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's so polite to his dad.
My family's completely different..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm home, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Emilio.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, are you leaving?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't expect to be long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, I'll
have dinner ready for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK, I'll be going, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, wait a moment, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What is it, <Marian>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Emilio,
There's something on my mind,
if you don't mind me telling you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sure...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
The way you spoke to that soldier
ealier, that wasn't very appropriate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though you outrank him,
he was still your senior.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
No one will want to follow your command
if you keep that up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...but that's...he was...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was what, exactly?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
You need to remember
what's expected of you,
someone of your rank.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...understand.
I'll be more careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, as long as you understand,
I'm glad that I told you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, that's all. Please be
careful, and come back safe.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
