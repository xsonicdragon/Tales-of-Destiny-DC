Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Hi, it's been a long time!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken me 
for someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't go away. Come on,
let's talk about it again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you really a different person?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, sorry about that.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
As you've realized your mistake.
Don't worry about it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that much like
the person you had met before?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If he see's you, he'll have 
an interesting reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
He seemed to be in a rush, so it 
will be impossible to find him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Then you should find 
somebody who might know him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'll mistake 
you for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that young lady doctor here?
Damn, I'm a fan of that girl.

[ENDBLOCK]
I am a princess trapped in a tower.
[ENDBLOCK]
Hostess
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, prince of the white horse.
When are you going to rescue me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Hostess
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, and you are?

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You will not touch the princess!
[ENDBLOCK]
Hostess
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell are you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I completely adore the princess.
But I'm the son of a simple farmer.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though her head knows the 
difference in status, her heart will
not let her give up on the princess.
[ENDBLOCK]
Hostess
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, do you love me that much?
[ENDBLOCK]
Hostess
[ENDBLOCK]
A relationship that transcends status.
That's the pure love I've always wanted!
[ENDBLOCK]
Hostess
[ENDBLOCK]
Save my body, my 
soul. Save me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I will protect the princess
for the rest of her life.

[ENDBLOCK]
Rookie Director
[ENDBLOCK]
But then I start to understand
the situation. I cry...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rookie Director
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it was wonderful.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rookie Director
[ENDBLOCK]
You can be a top star without a doubt.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rookie Director

Well, it's your first performance.
It's enough.

Rookie Director
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll explain it again then.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rookie Director
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be waiting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to the arena, the temple
of entertainment. Where you'll enjoy
blood-boiling battles.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw some smoke coming from the
city park. What's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell was
that monster!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Champion, we'll keep the
arena going, no matter what!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Until the champion returns, the arena
will remain a beacon of light!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Whether you want to watch or
participate, it's up to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
How can I help you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not like monsters usually
just attack a city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
They're attacking us from the sky,
that's a foul thing to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
We're still open for business,
but I'm not sure how long we'll last...
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm looking forward to the day when the
champion will make his triumphant return!
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I came out here from the country
to make a name for myself. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
But, when it comes down to it, I'm
too freaked out to go in there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I heard a scream. I hope... 
it was just my imagination.
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I helped people
evacuate the city too!
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Cha-Champion! An autograph, please!
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Ye-yeah! This time I'm in!
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if the sky is like
everywhere in the world...
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what kind of people come
to the arena at this kind of time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm still hanging around outside,
but I'm a lot more than that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm starting to think I'll never be
able to compete in the arena again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Armored Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care if I'm just a cheerleader.
Mighty, Mighty, Mighty!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
