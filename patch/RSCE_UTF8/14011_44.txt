Is there any food that you don't like?

I'm not particularly picky, but...
I really don't like sweets.

Yes, really. 
You don't believe me?

I saw you staring at the

I wonder how they are feeling right now.
I want to go check on him, but... hmmm.

Man

I've heard that if I were
to go to the downtown area,
I wouldn't be safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... What should I do?

Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish they'd get rid of the arena.
I hate dealing with those hoodlums.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It was this square that
suffered the most damage.

[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
On the contrary, it was fortunate
that the damage was concentrated
so that it could be quickly restored.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Ms. <Ilene> is too lenient with
people from downtown. I'd give
them a piece of my mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as Neuestadt is safe,
I don't care about the rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a bad situation indeed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman

Are you sure you just want lens?
I'll provide you funds for the army.

[ENDBLOCK]
So please, please, please!
Please help us.

Stop staring at me, leave me alone.

[ENDBLOCK]
I have my Softy Kreem Shop
back. I'm so relieved.

Boy

I had to buy another Softy 
Kreem because it melted after
all of the excitement.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
There are more kids from downtown
hanging around here these days.

Boy

I'm sure Neuestadt isn't the only
one that doesn't want to be hit.

Boy

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
