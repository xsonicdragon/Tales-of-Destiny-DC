<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp..my belly's full.
Let's head back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
How're you guys doing tonight?
How about a little contest at
tonight's side-show?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, sorry! That was rude of me. I'm simply
a wandering gambler, going from town to
town, on a never-ending journey.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, so there are people like
this, too? What do you mean
by "side-show"?
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a simple game. I throw
three dices, and you try to
guess the number.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're right, you'll win back
your gald and then some based
on the number you guessed!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... So what
are the rates?
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, for instance, if you guess 10 and it
lands on 10, you get 7 times your gald
back. If you guess 18 and it lands on 18,
you get back 200 times your gald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK Hang on a sec!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Ok so if he throws three dice
then the chance of them landing
such that they equal 10 is...12%!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...and 18 is...046%?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey wait a sec! Those odds
are massively in your favor,
aren't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey come on, I'm just offering
a little side-entertainment here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Just think of it as the
price of admission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, I don't think the
win rate is THAT bad...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is pointless. I'm not
wasting our gald on this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw come on <Rutee>,
can't I try it at least once?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh, you're hopeless.
Fine, here..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-?! One Gald!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Again, I'm not wasting our Gald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
So, which stakes do
you want to bet on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well OK. One Gald on 18 please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold up <Stahn>! You know you'd
have to roll 200 times for it to
maybe come up 18 just once right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to test
my luck, so I am!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Congratulations sir!
You win 200 gald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woohoo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why'd you only bet
one Gald you dope!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the?! <Rutee>, you said...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No excuses!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to continue?
What will the dice land on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All in on 18!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
THINK a little, <Stahn>!
It's not gonna land on 18 again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's my lucky number...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Congratulations sir! Your accurate
prediction has earned you a payout
of 40,000 Gald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woohoo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Am... am I dreaming...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to continue?
What will the dice land on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All in on 18!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, I get that you're lucky..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But please, stop here. 
It's impossible for the dice to
land on 18 three times in a row!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But haven't you heard the phrase
"What happens twice will happen thrice"? 
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Congratulations! With this,
your winnings come to...
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Eight Million Gald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woohoo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Man I'm lucky today.
Guess I'll stop for no-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oww! <Rutee> what gives!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep it rolling! All in on 18!!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, we've won enough.
Shouldn't we stop?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No you dope, it's your lucky
day right? Let's keep going!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
You would like to roll again?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, of course!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. Shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]

You lose all of your winnings.
[ENDBLOCK]

Cheater! You cheated!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Gambler
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? Don't be absurd!
You could have stopped
while you were winning,
couldn't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohno no no nononononono!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, give it up already.
It was bad luck.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
