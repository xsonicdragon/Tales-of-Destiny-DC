[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You found the [Glowmoss]?
That soft green glow...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It invokes such a sense
of bewitching beauty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Wonder if I'm losing it
in my advanced age.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I see you've found the [Will-o'-the-Wisp].
I understand the theory behind them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
And that's exactly why I can't stop
thinking about the souls of the dead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You found the [Black Worm]?
That thing was as quick as
it was abnormal-looking.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Finding it would be quite the task
for someone with my tired old eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Pah, it wasn't much
of a looker anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
So you've found the [Tablet of Laws].
The thieves who made off with it
during all that chaos with <Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
must've gotten hit during
Belcrant's bombardment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what I figure, anyway.
You reap what you sow.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
So here's what
I've got for you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a plant growing near
Rodeon that's out of this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not spoiling the surprise.
you'll have to see it for yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I've witnessed it
with my own two eyes. Got a
tough bodyguard with me, see?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Not to mention a backpack full of
Holy Bottles and legs quick enough
to carry me away from any danger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a spot near Deimos
where grudges left by earthly
creatures float about in the air.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Best not speak of
them too casually...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]

getting any angrier...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
