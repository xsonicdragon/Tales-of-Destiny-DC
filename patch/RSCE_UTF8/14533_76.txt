<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're here. This is the room with the
Guardian Dragon's control unit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we hold this place, we can stop
that Guardian Dragon, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait. I'm not going to let you
do anything more than you 
already have.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I recognize your voice.
I'm pretty sure it's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! We met at Calvalese.
Mr. <Baruk> of the Oberon Corporation!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
You remember well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Were Oberon's executives complicit
in <Hugo>'s misdeeds after all?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why would a fine man 
like you do this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is only the subjectivity of
your earthly people that sees
our actions as evil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
At the very least, I am acting based
on my firm beliefs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>, please don't do this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
This conversation is over. There is
nothing more to say between us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if it means the end of my life...
I will not waver in my beliefs...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you believe in covering the sky
with an outer shell and making the 
people on the ground suffer?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think you're
going to get out of it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I suppose I should tell you now. 
It's the revival of the heavenly realm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I'm a Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
My ancestors were defeated in the
Aeth'er War, and they had to
suffer through many hardships.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to avenge my ancestors.
It's no surprise you don't understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That doesn't mean you have 
to do this. There are other ways
to save Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why the Calvalese have 
suffered for so long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Aeth'er War is a holy war for us.
<Hugo>, please fulfill the Aetherians'
lifelong wish.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, we don't have much time.
You must operate the controls quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
How about...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone on the Swordian team. I have
just confirmed that the Guardian 
Dragon has stopped functioning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
This will also allow us to 
reduce the output of the shields and
focus our efforts on building a 
neutralization device.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want you to go through Deimos
and return to Ignasea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The next step was to go to
Helraios via Rodeon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going to work me to the bones.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, everyone, let's 
get out of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>... did you really think that
this was the only way to do it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't agree with that.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
