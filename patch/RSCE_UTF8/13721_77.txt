Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hahaha.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just a housewife's chat...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you. I haven't seen your face
around here, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm from the city of
Cyril in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, this is
your husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, am I !?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, my husband is
in Cyril.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right,
I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, don't worry. What are you
talking about here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
It's already decided for the aunts'
well-end meeting!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now, I'm talking about
General <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a little scary, isn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's true that some people
do think that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
But he's a very popular person
in Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That man?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Even though he is a
civilian employee, he is the one
who thinks about safety and
happiness first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a surprising fact. The next
time we meet, We'll make fun of
this story.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Making fun of me, <Mary>...
Are you <Rutee> now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to say to our customers,
but we are not currently
cashing lenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, this will run out of Gald.
[ENDBLOCK]

ask why!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to say to our customers,
but we are not currently
cashing lenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, we... that, I have to get
rid of my debt by tomorrow...
do I have to?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do
with the question?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to get rid of our
debt right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Otherwise, there may not
be a tomorrow
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you say so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I knew that I couldn't cash
it, so please tell me the reason.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
You can see it by going to the
house of General Oberon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s House?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I don't really like Mr. Hugo. He's handsome
and he seems nice enough, but there's just 
something "off" about him...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It's peaceful today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Dryden> is a wonderful man.
I will not allow anyone to deny it.

He was scared and hid in the

[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I was stung by

and had a very bad time.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Lion>, don't forget to bring 
a Panacea Bottle when you go.
[ENDBLOCK]

No, it's nothing...

Wahh! it's <Lion>! Wahhh!

Hey mama. Let's go on a picnic
on your next day off.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The number of <Lion>'s fans has
increased recently, but I was the
one who fell in love with him first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey mama. Let's go on a picnic
on your next day off.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a lot of soldiers
in the city. I wonder why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish <Lion> could beat
all the bad guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I went to the castle and left the
lens. I was also helpful, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Lion>? I was just
talking about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you <Lion>? Wow, you're
a beautiful guy even up close!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! I heard you've fulfilled
your great mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my, I can't believe you're
talking to me <Lion>. You're
really a cutie you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw the rumored <Lion> the other day.
He's such a pretty boy, I'm in love with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard a rumor from a soldier that <Lion>
has fulfilled another great mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen <Lion> lately, I wonder 
if he's gone somewhere far away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> where have you run off
to at such a terrible time?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
There are rumors that <Lion> was
a bad guy, but I don't believe them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Make a hole in that
damn outer shell!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you dare lose!

[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I hope you'll rise to the occasion.
It's not the era of the Seven Generals anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll dry
my futon today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I think <Lion> will be elected
for the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I hope you'll rise to the occasion.

[ENDBLOCK]
The voice that came from the sky,
it sounded familiar somehow?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that it was Oberon's CEO
who was broadcasting from the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what will happen
to Seinegald now...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please make the world
go back to normal.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Rumor has it that the Draconis
was attacked by monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any interesting gossip?
I'm bored out of my mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a rumor that the two countries

[ENDBLOCK]
Everywhere you go in town these days,
people are talking about <Lion> Magnus.
[ENDBLOCK]

impossible not to start rumors, right!?

[ENDBLOCK]

It seems that the Draconis crashed
into the mountains...Is it okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you guys know the situation?
Tell me what's going on!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If the sunlight disappears, the ground
will freeze in the blink of an eye...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I hear they're building a secret weapon
in the castle to breach the outer shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn, why... When I saw that
light, tears came out.

[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a handshake!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Make no mistake. You and I...
We are NOT equals!
[ENDBLOCK]

I can't stand laid-back, careless,
overly-friendly people like you.

[ENDBLOCK]
Straylize Temple is
North of Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]

There's a village called
Armeida along the way.
Let's head for there, first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have my doubts 
about this person...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The inhabitants of the city
are also quite upset.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No wonder.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you were shown such an aerial
city and even attacked...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian Masters! What the
hell is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow... such a huge building is
floating in the sky!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
And that intense light! What a
tremendous amount of technology!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, why are you so flirting
when your country is destroyed?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indiscriminate crustal fracturing
weapon Belcrant.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the true nature of the
light released from Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
As the name implies, it aims
to destroy the ground.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said the aerial city was used
in the Aeth'er Wars...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Aeth'er Wars...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I have no choice but to tell
you the truth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
A thousand years ago, there was a
great war involving all humankind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was the ground forces to which we
belonged and as such the Heavenly
Army of the aerial city.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the Aeth'er War...! It wasn't
just a legend, was it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni played 
a big role in the Aeth'er War.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was,"A sword caught in a
worldwide calamity".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I 'm sorry I didn't
say anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
We wanted to erase the memory of
the Aeth'er war from the
history of mankind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not to repeat, the mistakes
of the past.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
But as a result, the aerial
city has been revived...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
People of the earthly world!
Do you see our power?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What you see above you is the
aerial city of the Aeth'er War.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
That we have revived from a
thousand years long sleep!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
We do not forgive at all.
No exceptions are allowed.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It does not allow the people of
the earthly world who can only
crawl on the ground like insects.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I will confine everything on the
earthly world to the darkness.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait with trembling expectations!
Mwahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Hugo>. Are you going to pretend
to be the king of the heavenly
world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
The way he talks is
like that man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What should I do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you use the Draconis, you
can not reach that aerial city...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there no way for us to compete?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, not yet!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
As it is... Can I be left alone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you hear me, <Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who will make you like it!
Who will do what you want!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will definitely be rewarded...!
<Lion>'s enemies will definitely be taken!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you understand!
Remember, <Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
That spirit, young master.
well said!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That kind of...It can't be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, this voice
is unmistakable.
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian team, it's not the time
to be depressed!
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
We still have the potential!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Who?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mercurius <Ritora>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was the one who once led
us as the commander of the
ground forces.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
In case of an emergency, I also
transcribed my personality to
the core crystal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where does your voice come from...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
The communication function that is
built into me is being used.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I'm in the heart of Radisrol.
The strategy meeting is carried
out immediately from this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gather the Swordian team and
hurry to Radisrol!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is the first call order
in a thousand years.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you'll get by, right?
We can still do something
about it, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, <Stahn> Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be afraid under any
circumstances! Use all means
to accomplish your mission!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the Swordian team!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, I understand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, let's head
right out away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have already picked up the sea
dragon. Try going outside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Radisrol was moved to the sea.
Waiting for arrival.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Excellency, I would like to
work with them to gather information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, you have permission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew. I didn't think that
would take so long, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's very important that we seal
away the Eye of Atamoni properly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to the advice of the
Swordians, we were able to
create a perfect sealing facility.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
From now on, the armies of both 
our country and Seinegald will be
stationed there. Please rest assured.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've done all we can in
this era. We have no choice but
to have faith in you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I and <Chelsea>,
will return through Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, please come visit us
again in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Feel free to drop in at the castle.
You are always welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please leave <Mary> and
others to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I'll go visit
them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Until then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Then I will return to
the temple soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...It was really hard. Good work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't all like that. When it
was over, it was a fun trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
For me, who knew only inside
the temple, it was a good opportunity
to see the outside world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because everyone gave me
an opportunity. I am grateful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Likewise. Thanks to you,
it really helped me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well then, good luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Stahn>. Excuse Me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must apologize, I'm sorry
I have to say goodbye, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The next time we meet, 
I'll be stronger. 
Please look forward to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no guarantee that I
will be here when you return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I find a better master,
I won't hesitate to choose them, instead.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez. You could at least act like
you're sad to see me go. Oh well!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Ah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos> won't show it himself, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, what are you going to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What else? I'll
await further orders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've done a lot already. You
should take some time to rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such is my duty
as a Hedge Knight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad I was able to travel with
you, <Lion>. We went through a lot,
but it was fun.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you mimic me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Come on, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all that, you still
dislike me that much?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I consider you to be
a good friend, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't waste your breath.
I'll say this one more time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't stand laid-back, careless,
overly-friendly people like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...But...fine, I suppose
I can make a small exception.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is kinda nice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
..Hmph.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Stahn>, the Draconis is ready.
We can depart at any time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I should say goodbye to <Rutee>...
Wonder where she went?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw her in the
castle a while ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll go look for her.
Excuse me, can you wait for a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
[ENDBLOCK]

possible due to the absence
of Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a weird guy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there's something
going on between <Stahn> and <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not something I care
to intrude on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you're older sister might
be involved with someone!
Don't you wanna find out?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, not really.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, <Rutee> and I are
basically strangers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, forget about it.
Let's go back to the mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> is waiting for me.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
