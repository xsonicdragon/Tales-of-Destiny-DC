<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, those people again...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bring me all the money you can!
Don't worry about the money!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, yes. Once we get the
country  back, the royal family
will re-pay everything back!
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't fight on an empty stomach!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
With us, there's no doubt we'll win!
Because we are the heroes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are Dark,the Dark Wings♪
Awesome mercenaries, yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hello, everyone.
I never thought I'd 
see you in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. I used to be in
Aquaveil, but we hitched
a ride and came here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to take advantage
of the commotion in this country
and raise a flag this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe they'll take
advantage of the commotion.
That's awful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need a favor from you guys.
I need you guys to clear the
snow off the roof for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Snow removal?
Why are we doing this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
The rooftops are an important
base of operations in case of
a battle in the city.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a given, you must be ready to go
into action. If you're a good mercenary,
you already know that, don't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, uh... of course I know that.
I don't have a choice, I'll do it.
<John>, <Millie>, let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now I don't have to do the snow
removal myself. I guess it's all 
about how you use the commotion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa...
Did you con those people?
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
You're not staying overnight,
are you? Well then...
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any info
about the cat?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, we're here to help
you find your cat.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? !
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
As you can see, I can't
leave this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
But I'm so worried about my cats.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. I know exactly how you feel.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But hey, if you don't know
where they are at all, there's
no way to find them, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any
other information?
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
As a matter of fact, I do.  I have a
report that a cat that looks like
that was seen in the Tilso Forest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's hurry to Tilso Forest!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Quickly...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then we'll head for
the Tilso Forest, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention.
I have ten cats in total.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ten of them!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, yeah.

[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]

has escaped again.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Could you please go
and get him again?
Yes

[ENDBLOCK]
Um, excuse me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, what is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's actually
something I'm 
looking for.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, I've heard
that it's deep in the forest of
Tilso in the north.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure? !
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. I'll go to that Tilso
forest as soon as possible then.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, miss, are
you going alone?
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Where are your friends?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't tell anyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to do it by myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, let me go to the Tilso
Forest in the north that 
the innkeeper mentioned.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going to surprise
your brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that it's deep
in the forest of Tilso.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
But I can't believe you're going alone.
Please don't do anything rash.
[ENDBLOCK]
select
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you want to give up today?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, let's go to the Tilso
Forest in the north that 
the innkeeper mentioned.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going to surprise
your brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh... big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Lilith>. Where have you
been all by yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was worried because you
left without saying anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to get out of the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, let's get back
to the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll give you this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this a ... medicinal herb?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But why?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was walking outside 
and stumbled upon it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then why don't you use it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, God!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're in a fight to save the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You need it more than I!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right.
I'll take it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay. Make good use of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you don't use it properly,
even when you're awake...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, <Lilith>. I'll use it.
I promise I'll use it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
See you soon.
Thank you, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>

You're welcome.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
