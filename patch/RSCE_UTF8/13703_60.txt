The garden is soothing.
It helps me feel relaxed, which means
I can concentrate on security.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all thanks to Master <Lion>
that the Draconis is back.

[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we been deceived by
<Lion> and <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>...
Is that the name of the mastermind?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The Lens Cannon is mankind's trump
card. We must protect it at all costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sunlight is a beautiful thing...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The castle is amazing, but it
does have some weaknesses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, there's no way in hell that 
this place is going to be breached.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, the Empress has not been
seen. It seems she is in poor health.

[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> was able to take the Draconis
because we were overconfident in
our security.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Our responsibility is too heavy.
What should we do...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon's CEO <Hugo> broadcasted that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are headed to <Reynolds>' lab,
take the door on the left.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that the barrel of Belcrant's
gun fell into the sea?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Until the Lens Cannon is complete,
I'll protect this place at all costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of the world for me, alright?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Dryden's uncle played
with me the other day.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The people at the castle
have been on edge lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Why did this war start?
How can we end it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
We shouldn't go out cause it's
dangerous outside the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he would gather all the
lens in the world in this garden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, there's a hole in the sky!
A hole！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon
will be built here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon will be
finished soon. Please procure the lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon is complete.
All that's left is to carry out the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll never forget what you taught
me, Commander.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
... Please, for the sake of the commander,
make sure you defeat <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> is currently
unavailable at the moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
But don't worry, our country's elite
Researchers are here to help you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, so this is the Lens Cannon.
It's pretty big, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to have to shoot through
the hull. It's the only way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems the energy source, the lens,
is coming along nicely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder how much I'd get for
selling all these lens...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you don't need to be so
attached to lens anymore, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know... but seeing this gets
my treasure senses tingling...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess it's the nature of
an ex-lens hunter...？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey bro, long time no see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, it's you！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhhhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's <Walt>, from Harmentz.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, <Walt>!
Umm...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to pretend to remember.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard lots about you.
You've been doing well, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not like I'm playing an essential role.
I'm just trying to do my best.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Same here. We could use the help.
Hey, you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've gathered all the lens in Harmentz
Use them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks!
<Walt>, you're a great guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no, no.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just trying to be a good citizen
by following your example.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, it's thanks to you that
I'm here now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey... can I have a word with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. <Reynolds>, you had、
something to tell us?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. ...Actually, the amount of lens
we have is still not enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even with so many?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll need triple or quadruple of what's
here to reach the targeted output...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm starting to feel lightheaded...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha!	It's gonna be nice and loud,
ain't it? After all, fireworks have
to be flashy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's impossible for Seinegald to
produce that much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
And thus, I have a favor to ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you go around the world
and gather the lens for me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry to keep asking for help, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No problem.
I'll help out with anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks.
That's really kind of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've already requested other countries
to gather the lens in their major cities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Neuestadt, Heidelberg, 
Calviola, and Terazzi.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Should we go in that order?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's up to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then it'll be easy to discuss.
We'll head over soon.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
