<Johnny>'s Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Where is our youngest...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
How long do you intend on moping around?
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Johnny>! You're back!
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you've finally made your decision!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, and I have no intention to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
My father was once the Emperor of Aquaveil.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. And that's why you're gonna
get your throne back from that boy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father, the Emperor's throne is not
hereditary to start with.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
And give me a break. The title of Emperor
does not fit me in the first place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nonsense! You are the sharpest
amongst your brothers and the
populace trusts you!
[ENDBLOCK]
You should also be dressing appropriately and...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems I'm not getting through to you.
Let's go <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
Why...Why are you like this...
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you afraid of <Johnny>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord of Shiden
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Where did our youngest go?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>It's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Master <Johnny>. How unusual
for you to be back home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Master Arthur and his wife are very
friendly and easy to serve.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
"A woman's place is at home", was once
a firmly held belief in this country...
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
This country has changed a lot ever
since Master Arthur came into power.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
The Shiden family has been working
very hard in order to break the current
deadlock, barely sleeping or resting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take good care of Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
The Lens gathering has been going
on with no problems Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be praying for everyone's and
Master <Johnny>'s safety.

[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder where <Johnny> went off to.
He just keeps wandering around doing nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I didn't know you were in Moreau.
No wonder you were nowhere to be found.
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know <Johnny> was in Moreau.
No wonder he was nowhere to be found.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> has been getting it together
under <Fayte>'s supervision.
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard the one responsible for the
current situation is from Seinegald. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>! Is it true you went to Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
I want Seinegald to take responsibility
for making the world such a mess.
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if things will really be fine
if we gather enough lenses?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will things really be fine if we
gather enough lenses?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, you are going to the Shell
aren't you? Please come back safely.
[ENDBLOCK]
Make sure <Johnny> comes back safely.

[ENDBLOCK]
This may come off as the words of
a doting parent, but my children are
a treasure more precious to me than
this world.

Lord of Shiden
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't just stand there <Johnny>. Come
and have some tea with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
I am Arthur, ruler of this land. I don't
think I've seen you guys before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aquaveil was founded by Count Michel Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
The Shiden family is directly descended from him.
[ENDBLOCK]
I am no longer be the Emperor.
The time has come for the younger generation.
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought I'd be able to retire comfortably
and leave it to the youngsters,
but I can't say that now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, you will serve well as a
representative of our country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> is our country's representative.
That makes me proud as a father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Go <Johnny>! Show them what
Shiden men are made of!
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please look forward to
<Johnny>'s Siden spirit!
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Master <Johnny>.

[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
This estate is the main castle of
the Shiden territory. Make sure you
don't forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Shiden has no fortresses.
That is a tradition passed down from
Count Michel himself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that things are much more
difficult in the countries across the sea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried that other countries will
take advantage of this chaos and attack us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Johnny>, you can order me to
do anything that is within my capabilities,.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Please let me know if there is
anything I can do to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord of Shiden
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you need something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please pardon the intrusion.
We're looking for some rope.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you happen to have any,
would you mind lending it to us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Barging in so suddenly and making
demands is awful rude, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
On top of that, you all look
like you're not from here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold it. That has nothing
to do with anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there something I can
help you with, honored guests?
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, my lord, there's no
need for you to trouble yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't mind at all. Foreign
visitors are rare, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you! You see...
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, I see. Thank you for 
explaining it, even though
you're in such a hurry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, do you mind
lending us some rope?
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe we have some in
the storehouse at the harbor.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, but do you
mind fetching it for them?
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Whuh!? I...Certainly...
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way. You've come
from Seinegald, haven't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We do. You're
very observant, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ack! S-Sorry, sir!
Please forget what I said!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps the old me would have
immediately seized you, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. Just kidding.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, sir...
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
I've brought you the rope.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is a big help. Thank you,
from the bottom of my heart.
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't mention it. Now then,
run along and help your friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK, let's go, <Philia>.

<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople

interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's

Something fun may happen.
