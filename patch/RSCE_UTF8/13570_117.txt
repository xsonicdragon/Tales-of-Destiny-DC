[ENDBLOCK]
There might be someone over there. 
Let's go have a look.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There is a pedestal
where the sword was placed.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>The screen seems to be showing
the status of the ship.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gramps...
<Lilith>...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No...! I don't want to die
in a place like this!

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
You there!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you can hear my voice.
Perhaps you have the ability.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-who's there?

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to know?
Then come deeper inside.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Deeper?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Something shined...
way over there.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no one here...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is... a sword?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It has a pretty weird shape,
can I even use this...?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Arghh, this isn't the time
to worry about that!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as I have a weapon,
I won't lose to the likes of you!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with this sword? It's weird,
like my hand is already used to it...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Draconis...!
Will it be okay?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what's going
on outside?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Wh-Where am I...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>! You're awake!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're in the Draconis' warehouse.
Do you remember anything?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I do...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I fought <Hugo>, and...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that, they imprisoned us in here.
I think It's been about five days now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>...I was so worried
you might not wake up. I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal...I'm sorry
for worrying you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't even
put up a fight...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was expected, considering
who you were up against.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I really am pathetic, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thinking I'm invincible just
because I have you, Chal...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Changing my name, saying
it's so I can be my own man...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...and acting like I knew what was
best for my sister, not telling
her who I really was...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, I'm nothing
more than a selfish failure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't blame yourself!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of
Hedge Knight am I??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't even protect
a single person!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
DAMN IT!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why am I such a coward?!
Why do I lie to others?! To myself?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why am I so pathetic???
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you've awoken.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get up. Our preparations
are complete.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get up?	Don't
waste your breath.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no reason for me to listen 
to you anymore. <Marian> is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> is alive and well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha...You're
quite the lucky boy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is something only
you can do for me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I've decided to allow
<Marian> to live a little longer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this true...?
<Marian> is still alive!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha! Believe it or not!
I'll leave it to you...
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
