[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
He's more popular with the people of

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm? You are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we met before?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I've never spoken with you before.
But, I've heard a lot about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am one of the Seven Generals,
<Isard> of the Dawn Sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm <Stahn> Aileron.
It's nice to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What were you doing
here Mr. <Isard>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was looking at the ocean...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did I interrupt you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
No. I was just looking for
someone to chat with.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Umm... I can talk with you if you want.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're just as they say.
Pure and straightforward.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, thank you very much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
To tell the truth, I'm...
not a Seinegaldian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If people knew that, would you
have to leave the Seven Generals!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. It's a well known fact.
Don't worry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the past, there was a civil war in
my country. At the time, I was exiled.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
And then, this country accepted
me with open arms.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, you're still worried about
your... hometown.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've left so much behind...
And you may hate me for it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hate...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've rambled on too long...
So long, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Isard>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems <Stahn> was safe...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you... know <Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
As I thought... Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You... are from Aquaveil?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Indeed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Mr. <Isard>.
He's one of the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's impressive.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please pass judgement on me!
Master <Johnny>!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, whoa, what are you on about?
Why do I have to pass judgement you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that, Mr. <Isard>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because... I left Master Gino to die...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know <Fayte>'s dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, let's hear it.
Then we'll decide.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>、This is our problem.
Please don't interfere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
When <Tiberius> ascended the throne,
I abandoned my country... Master Gino...
and went into exile to this country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
The regret of fleeing 
always follows me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
The only information I could
get in this country was...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
that Master Gino had passed away...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only I hadn't fled...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only I stayed by Master
Gino's side...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
None of this would
have happened...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, he might not have died.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, if you stayed, you might
have died.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who know what would have
happened if you stayed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, Master <Johnny>, Master
<Fayte> should know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be so vain.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not like <Fayte> would remember
every single soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if I had to pass jugdement,
it would be...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
To protect the people of this land
at all costs, as the member of
the Seven Generals!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
And, for you to visit your hometown
once in a while. That's all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Isard>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you. This <Isard> shall accepted
this punishment for the rest of his life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it？
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry. It's just that you have
the same eyes as me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Same... eyes?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
The eyes of a person who
lost a loved one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
A good friend of mine lost his
life in the ocean.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to see the ocean...
but I'm afraid of forgetting my
friend if I leave.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
You should try revisiting the place
where you lost your loved ones.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'll be happy
to see you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where <Lion> died...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, I wish I could live happily
without sorrow.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
They gave me a gas that made me feel
weak and couldn't work afterwards.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you hear that broadcast?
That was Oberon's CEO <Hugo> talking.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew I was right, didn't I?
Oberon Corporation was evil!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone involved with Oberon
Corporation should be arrested.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
No matter how many lenses
they produce, Oberon will
never be forgiven.

The CEO of Oberon Corporation is
a bachelor. I've heard that there are

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
