<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
So did you find out
the truth of the matter?
[ENDBLOCK]
<IGNORE>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yea. It'll be fine if we
leave this to <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK. There are two major
points to the case.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>First off...
This girl talks to cats in a loud voice.
This girl really likes fish.
The existence of a secret passage is doubtful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>And also...
The people who're attacked always 
have two injuries on them. 
This girl is from Shiden.
This girl is still very young.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does that really have
anything to do with the
truth of the case at hand?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...My bad. Let me think
about this again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no need to rush. 
Think over it carefully.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK. Who is the culprit?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The person who actually 
committed the crime...
...was you, <Fayte>!
...was you, <Johnny>!
...was that soldier there!
...was you, little girl!
...was you, <Rutee>!
...was the ghost of <Tiberius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>, you joking 
around or what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have anything 
to base that on??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this true!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're saying I'm the culprit
even though I've been with you
LITERALLY THE WHOLE TIME?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...not just saying it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're counting on you here, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
M..Me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
That can't be!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why would he attack
his comrade?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
..Aha..hahah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this true!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>. Should I get
really angry for a bit?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...my bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>, you joking
around or what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I was thinking of someone
who would have had a grudge.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is no time for jokes!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you basing that on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, this girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Has a twin!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And so the other of the
two must still be in this
house somewhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
How did you know!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I figured that it was possible there
were two culprits since the victims
always had two injuries on them
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Furthermore, based on the testimony
that I had at first thought implied the
use of a secret passage, I concluded
we must be dealing with twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. What about the testimony
about her talking to a cat?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
As for that, while one of them
committed the crime, the other
made a scene talking to the cat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This gave them
the perfect alibi.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's pretty funny. So then
what about the two injuries
each victim had?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Simply put, because there were two of
them, the one doing the crime inflicted
two injuries to represent that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But why, though? Why would
these two small kids attack
our soldiers like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
By chance are you from
the House of Terazzi?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We are. Even though we're distant
relatives, we suffered greatly
from Lord <Tiberius>' death.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was it really enough for
you to go this far?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you could say, we were the
ones who created criminals out
of these kids?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what will happen 
to them now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well...luckily, the soldier's injuries
weren't very severe at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Considering they're children as
well as their circumstances...
We'll let them off easy this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't do anything bad from
here on out. Got it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. We apologize.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. We apologize.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
At any rate, that was awesome!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw shucks, it was nothing.
A book I read once had the
same trick in it..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even so, that was impressive.
You have my gratitude, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
