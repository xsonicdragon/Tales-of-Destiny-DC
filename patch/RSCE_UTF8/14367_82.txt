[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, the report on the 
damage caused by the recent 
rebellion of <Greybum> is here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I'll read it now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, I've prepared the documents
for the princess candidates, please be sure
to read through them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sure I want to... 
but I'll take a look.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, the draft of
the military budget for this
year has been finalized.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, I have submitted 
a proposal for the reserves of 
the castle and I hope you will 
take a look at it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I drew everyone 
and His Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow! I'll definitely look at it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
As you know, your father, Isaac,
passed away during the recent
<Greybum> Rebellion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
And your mother passed
 away before that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty was very young when he
lost his mother, and he spent many
days holed up in his room.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
And after three days
and three nights.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
King Isaac dragged His Highness
out of the room by force.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That mild-mannered Lord Isaac?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, and he scolded him severely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
"You have the nation in front of you 
and the people behind you!" He said.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What does that mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the king stops walking, the 
people will stumble and the 
nation will never prosper.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tough life...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Kingship means existing between
a country and its people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why when Master Isaac died, 
he was able to suppress his anger 
and hold back his grief.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
For the country he had to 
escape without looking back

<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, what is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like I have work to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
You should have leave 
such matters to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I've been asked to do it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It won't take long, why don't
you wait here for me
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand, 
Do your best
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>, Can I ask
you a question?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened to your
family, <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it looks 
like you're back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry to keep you 
waiting. Now, let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just happy to be 
playing in the castle again!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, I'll give you 
that candy you wanted.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>You're going away...?

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that when the shell is 
completed, it will be completely 
dark even in the daytime.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
What will happen now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that it collects the energy
of the lens to destroy the shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I- Impossible!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Come back for sure!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
