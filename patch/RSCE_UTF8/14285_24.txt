Is something wrong boy?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? Is that so?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, that is so.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. I thought you were
<Woodrow> for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
But you should be more careful.
You look just like this bad guy
called <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Aren't you King Isaac's
son <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
... Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, but why aren't you hiding it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I were to hide or
evade the question...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to lie.
That's simply it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Umm, <Woodrow> seems a lot
cooler then I thought he'd be.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, aren't you...?

<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who, Me?

select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007> I think I rememberyou, but...
I'm sorry. I don't remember you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You look well, miss <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's strange. I remember your face,
but I can't seem to remember you at all...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. Don't worry about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I used to be a mercenary you see.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
And I remember seeing you once in
this town when I still working.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you remember me,
even if it's only my face.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
When I came back to this town I
wondered if I would see you again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, in any case.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If a beauty like you were to die,
I would be deprived of some
viewing pleasure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
How unfortunate. I kinda feel dejected.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no, don't worry about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
We can still live in this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to the King of Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
We can still live in this
world thanks to the King.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
They used to hate him so much...
It's so strange.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>!
I-I was rude.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
No. Those words were from your heart,
it makes me happy to hear them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it is also thanks to <Mary> and <Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It also makes me happy to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
So, <Mary>, are you going to see <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys don't mind?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Go ahead.
[ENDBLOCK]

Captain <Dalis> is the hero of Cyril.
He spent 2 years in a cell and survived.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
It would be good if he got better quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
What is the Aeth'er War...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Belcrant...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been very cold lately.
I wonder if it's because the sky is dark.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Those craters were opened using
a secret Lens waepon right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
GO! GO! GO!
King <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
GO! GO! GO!

[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm very glad captain <Dalis> is still alive.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain <Dalis> was originally a moderate.
He never liked conflict.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Amid all the violence 2 years ago
someone had to be chosen to lead us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
We are all sick and tired of war.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
At this rate, not only this city but the
entire country will be smothered by ice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
We only have to hand over our lenses
right? We can keep our food?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>? So you were fine after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen you people before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If I were <Mary> I'd be going to a hot
spring in Frostheim with captain <Dalis>
right about now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>? You're still alive!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen you people before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, you were separated from
your husband once again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary> was separated from her
husband once again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
But they have a strong bond,
so it will be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder when the day will come
when we will be able to live in peace.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If that Belcrant were to attack our
town directly... that's dreadful...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if we are so sinful that we
have to go through such pain.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary> went through so much and fought
so hard, I don't think we have a right
to complain.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
There are lenses in in Heidelberg.
You should go get them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
There are lenses in in Heidelberg.
You should go get them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary> was able to come back alive.
You too have this duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You come back alive you hear me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If it wasn't for Lord <Greybum> on
our side, it wouldn't have worked
out this way.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> used us to take
control of this country.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We were finally able to reconcile with
the Royal family, but what happens now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter how much snow you shovel,
it won't matter if the city is destroyed...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I intend to keep on doing what
I can to help everyone.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani>
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles.
The first is to [Set your title and
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,
and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
