<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't fool my eyes. Give
back those Lens you stole.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm. So what? People who get
robbed deserve it, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that..?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No sign of regret, huh?
Well then, what should
we do with you?

It's OK, <Rutee>. I don't think
he's going to steal anymore.

[ENDBLOCK]

We haven't stolen ANYTHING
from you! You're the one who-
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut up! You took our
freedom, our happiness!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What did you say??
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
So far, you've acted like those
who get robbed deserve it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Then when it happens to you,
you complain about how awful
thieves are!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Now's my chance!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Why did you just stand
there like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry..it's just, it reminded me about 
what <Baruk> said a while ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
About how the people here "Still 
dwell on the war so long ago".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But when that kid said "You act like
people who get robbed deserve it"
...is that what he meant?
[ENDBLOCK]

If you're having trouble,
take it outside of town.

They show up here from time to time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Junkland"?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It's a town made up of garbage
west of here. Not that that place
concerns you at all, of course.

That drunk guy over there moved

about six months ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
But on the way there, his

fell on Seinegald!?

That place is nothing but trash.

Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not so bad when it's dark all the time.

is only a sales clerk.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that the heavens have come
down on Seinegald. I wonder what
the people in the temple are thinking.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like Seinegald aren't
the only one in trouble...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I told the guys at the temple,
If there is a Goddess then make
her do something about it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Then they became silent.
I knew there was no Goddess!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There are no gods, but there are
heroes. You guys look amazing.

<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong Young Master?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Chal. The people here...
They're incredible, aren't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Living like normal in a desert
like this...I wouldn't last a day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're certainly right. If they didn't
work together, I doubt
they'd last this long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
....
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal...I know I've said
this a lot, but...I absolutely
must succeed in this mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. I know it means
a great deal to you, Master <Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. If this goes well,
I can stop being <Hugo>'s son...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...and finally become known for
my own deeds, as <Lion> Magnus.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
..And then, surely...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You want to meet
with <Marian>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you
even asking, Chal...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
About what you said, earlier.
I wonder if that's really true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Earlier..? You mean about the 
people here living in the desert?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. How the people here are able
to live by working together...
I'm not so certain about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not normal to live
in a harsh environment like
this desert, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's a little different
from what you said, Chal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What if...in order to
maintain resources...they
abandoned those who were a burden?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Abandoned...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, that's right. That's why
these people are strong.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's the opposite, right?
Only the strong can survive, here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you saying this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know...but I get the feeling
that someday I'll be forced
to make a similar decision...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And when that time comes...
what if I make the wrong decision?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. I know you'll

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
