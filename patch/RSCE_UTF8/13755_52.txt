<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe that they'd
call me a greedy woman...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, people have been treating us who
live in the mansion harshly, as though we
were the same as the Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been accused of being a greedy
woman after the company's fortune...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How could they say
such awful things!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Marian>, why don't
you leave this place?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thats..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That way, that way you won't
be hurt anymore, <Marian>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thats...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what he wanted...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Regardless,
you should go, <Marian>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No. I'm staying put!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You would go that far...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss... <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Marian>...I have
something to ask of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the future, when everything is properly
fondly remembered, you can visit...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you do, make sure
you get out of here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Rutee...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please...stop suffering so much
for people who aren't here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because if you're not happy,
I'm sure he'll be very angry...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, Miss <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, don't push
yourself too hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]

Are you here to see the
Master of the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]

Master <Lion>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take charge of the house
until Master <Lion> returns.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome, Mr. <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
So it's just you and me today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
... please, help us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well? How was it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Delicious. Every bit of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad! You've made
today's cook very happy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Today's cook"? Is the
usual Head Chef not here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. The Head Chef is on
leave due to illness, so
I cooked everything, tonight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's amazing, <Marian>.
It was just as good as usual!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Emilio, you're 
just saying that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not at all. It's the truth!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. In that case, I've got
some shopping to do tomorrow, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shopping?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
While the Head Chef is on leave, I'll be
doing the shopping as well as the cooking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really...Do you want
me to come along?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's OK. I'm only
going to go around the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm...When you put it that way,
I want to go with you even more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Think of it as me making
sure you're not slacking, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, OK. I guess
I can't refuse that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! There you are!
I had no idea where you were!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
To have served such a wonderful man,
in such a wonderful home...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was...truly...happy.
Thank you...Emilio...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying, <Marian>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-Where are
you going?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Goodbye...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>! Wait!!
D-Damn, I...I can't move...!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
