<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The ruins are located in the 
inner bay area, south of the 
second continent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here there is a device called the 
R Key, which is used to levitate 
Radisrol.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want you to retrieve it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Currently, there are seven aerial 
cities that can be confirmed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
First of all, I want you to head to
Ignasea, which is the closest one 
from here.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ignasea has a transporter terminal
that connects the aerial cities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, we must seize this place
first and open the route to each city.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can't we go directly to 
Dycroft from Ignasea? 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a device terminal in 
Dycroft, but it's probably not
working. I wouldn't count on it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Next, from Ignasea, we will use the 
transporter to get to Deimos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
After conquering Deimos, we will
go  out to the outer shell land and
aim for Cloudius.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The control facility for the 
Guardian Dragon is most likely
located in Cloudius.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will disable the Guardian
Dragon there and ensure the
safety of Radisrol.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's fair. Radisrol's very
existence is at stake if we 
leave that thing unattended.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once you have conquered Cloudius,
you will be sent back to Ignasea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that, head to 
Helraios via Rodeon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Helraios used to be a technological
research facility for the Heavenly 
Host.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can use the equipment 
there to fix <Igtenos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, my God. Can we do that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The mirror barrier neutralization 
device will be activated using the 
Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
In order to release the full
output of the device, <Igtenos>
is definitely needed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The last one is Mikheil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Again, we go back to Ignasea, and
this time we asked him to go through
Josaia.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe there was a floating 
cruiser left behind in Mikheil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, we're going to take
it to the dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. This concludes
the overview.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
