Hey, good to

[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh? <Lion> isn't
with you today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh it's you guys again!
That's enough!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, when he was there,
he cried at his father <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. And rumor has it that he and his
father are being hunted by the military.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Watch it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? I'm afraid I can't 
hear you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Today is the day I'm going
to make you my woman.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys are so freaking annoying.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Wanna say that again, you bitch!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine, I'll say it again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I said that you guys freaking ANNOYING!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a woman,
and you're doing it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll wait until you guys 
get your swords up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just take it from there...
I'm serious!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to
back off now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rude Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about that.

Manager
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, I haven't seen any of 
those hooligans wooing you lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess you've learned your
lesson, haven't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got a girl pointing
a sword at you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What does it matter how
long ago that was?
[ENDBLOCK]
Manager
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you know <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell is
wrong with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for your time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Where have
we met before?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about, <Stahn>?
You're that rogue soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A lot has changed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you took off your armor, 
you looked different.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I have quit my job as a soldier
and am helping out with the family 
business in the countryside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So, um...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Speak up.

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Please come with
me to my country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way, that's...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I want you to
meet my parents.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, I can't do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Turn it down, fast!
[ENDBLOCK]
Manager
[ENDBLOCK]
Turn it down, fast!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I still have a lot of work to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Oh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Together, we can't go to
your country, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It made me really happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Besides...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just want to say thank you.

Have they learned what reality is?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
This is a business practice known as
cosplay. It's quite popular in the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like we should at least have
normal uniforms while we're getting ready.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to see my new outfit, you'd
better come back a winner for sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A way to the top, huh?
I wonder how we can do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>, do you have any ideas?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I do not.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, <Dymlos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been acting strange since we
got back to Earth, haven't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You barely speak anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's brainstorm together. 
We'll figure out what to do from
here on out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
About that, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys have done really well.
But I can't do it anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What boring joke are you making?
It doesn't look good on you, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is not a joke. This is the
calm judgment of a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
As <Woodrow> said, we have no 
way to get up there anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't know.
Maybe there is a way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if we do get up there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are no match for <Miktran>.
You've already seen what he can do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe next time we can win.
You don't know unless we try!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We do! We are no match for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
And the reason is clear!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you guys hiding 
something from us?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can find that at...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fake Swordian Masters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
These are the words that 
<Miktran> threw at us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been trying to figure out
what it means. Isn't the answer 
shown in this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think, Swordian?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
There are certain conditions that
are necessary for a Swordian to
reach its maximum power.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean the six of us?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nope. That's important, 
but it's not a requirement.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The condition is that the 
personalities of the Swordian
and the Master are identical.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Umm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
"It is only by becoming fully attuned to
the wielder's spirit that the Swordian 
can achieve its true potential."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's our true purpose. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's one of the reasons why 
<Miktran> was so strong.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
The core crystal of <Belserius> has
been overwritten by <Miktran>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as we are different people,
we are not as good as the original 
Masters?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
So <Miktran> called us fake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>, You knew that this entire 
time and didn't say anything?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be ridiculous.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is that?
Don't say that now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't mean to deceive you.
I have done my best.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your growth has been remarkable.
I knew you could handle this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
But when you're dealing with <Miktran>, 
that's as far as you can go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you're telling me to give up?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not gonna let you do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You brought me all the way out here,
and now you want to just give up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll figure it out.
With our own hands, somehow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't do what you can't do!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any idea what 
you're doing? You can't do 
this with guts alone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I was out of line.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was it okay for you to say 
that to <Stahn> earlier?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want you to be in a hurry to
live because you're too driven by a 
sense of mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay to have an object of 
obsession close at hand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
That makes sense.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
But in reality, they 
may just be amused.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just well, what can I say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe it was a mistake not to see that
there was another factor at play.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Another element?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, sweetheart?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
One milk! In an extra large mug!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, have a bad day?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it's milk, I can drink it, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, we all have times when we 
want to drink. Even if it's milk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes.
Yo!	Me too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, come on. You don't want milk.

Titles are one of the character parameters

<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
