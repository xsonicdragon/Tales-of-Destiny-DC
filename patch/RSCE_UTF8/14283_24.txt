[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this about father?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Father lived in a very hot
place when he was a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And where is your father now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Father died in the last war.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fine. I'm actually happy to see
something looking for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Here, take this. As thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]

Speaking of which, father used to

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
... What do you mean...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
You look the part,
are you adventurers too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, would
you have a look at this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
An adventure friend of mine
sent me this picture.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
And somehow, a different adventurer
friend of mine sent me another picture
that looks just like the first one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there's any
meaning to this picture...
I sure don't get it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If you have time, would you go look
around for this place?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know where it is, so use
this picture as reference.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll stay here for a while longer,
if you want to look at the picture
again just come to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, if you find anything in this
place, come and tell me. I'll reward you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll also introduce you to my friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
The three of them are currently on
Cyril, Straylize Temple, and Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh? Are you <Stahn> by any chance?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, yes...
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Has an adventurer asked you to
look at a picture recently?
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm his friend and this
is the picture I took.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to see this picture
again come see me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Look at the picture again?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, so that's what happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
Here's your reward.
Please take it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Adventurer
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take my leave now.
See you.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll refer you to my friends,
the ones who took the pictures.
[ENDBLOCK]
They are in Cyril, Straylize Temple,
and Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]

Could you be...
Your Majesty... King <Woodrow>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
A declaration of war on the entire
surface...? Are they serious?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
That thing completely
cratered the surface...
Is that Belcrant's power?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this the end of humanity?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was instructed by captain
<Dalis> to collect the lenses...

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If a city were to be hit by Belcrant...
How many people would die!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't been able to rest lately...
I keep thinking Belcrant might
strike again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We will do what we can here.
Please, save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We were able to win the battle
because Lord <Greybum> was on our side.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
People were praising Lord <Greybum>
a little while ago, and now they're
all badmouthing him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, the grown-ups are just
putting all the blame on Lord <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky is looking weird.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky flashed and made a
loud sound out of nowhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
What will we do if the
whole sky is blocked?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The lenses in this city were
all sent to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
When did we start chumming
up to that town's people?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
If everybody joins forces together
we will definitely win.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
