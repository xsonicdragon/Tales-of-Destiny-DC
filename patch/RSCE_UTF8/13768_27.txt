Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, on my way back 
to the village, I was attacked 
by a monster.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
At that time, I was helped by
<Ascus>, of the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
But he was unfriendly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Hi, it's been a long time!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken me 
for someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't go away. Come on,
let's talk about it again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you really a different person?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, sorry about that.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
As you've realized your mistake.
Don't worry about it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that much like
the person you had met before?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If he see's you, he'll have 
an interesting reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
He seemed to be in a rush, so it 
will be impossible to find him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Then you should find 
somebody who might know him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'll mistake 
you for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Wasn't that big hairy guy
with you the other day?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time you see him,
give this to that man.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, did you stop braiding?
It was looking good on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, General <Ashley> !!
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
This is <Ashley>, the general
who saved the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Ashley> is wonderful!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if she will 
live in our village!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
The people in this village, 
they're calling my name!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're even calling me,
"General <Ashley> the savior
of the village!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have to wear
a mask anymore!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
The people in this village, 
they're calling my name!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're even calling me,
"General <Ashley> the savior
of the village!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not replacing my
brother anymore!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, you used to say 
to the King that your brother
managed to do it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
My brother is the founder of
the Seven Generals named <Finlay>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, my brother was an amazing man.
Both in terms of his sword skills and 
his charm as a person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
But why is a person with
a mimi so short-lived?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to that, people around me
started expecting me to be <Finlay>,
not <Finlay>'s younger brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you hate your older brother?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I still love it. That's
why I also sang...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...But I couldn't be
an older brother...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the norm. I wasted
a lot of time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's really true.
Because you are you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad that worked. Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
For a while, I'll continue to
protect the entire village.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Welcome to Armeida. Be sure to
stay at the inn before worshiping!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the village of Armeida, at
the foot of the Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
What a terrible thing! Oh God,
please help me...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
May you all have
God's blessing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
From the temple, Atamoni always
watches over our lives.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
Rumor has it that something
happened in the temple, but
it's true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
I've lived for more than 60 years
and I've never had this before...
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
Rumor has it that something
happened in the temple, but
it's true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
What will happen to the
temple from now on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
With the help of Bishop Ayles, the
reconstruction of the temple seems
to be proceeding smoothly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
At such times, the blessing of
the Atamoni is necessary.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
If we can cooperate,
we will do anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys are also worshipers of
Straylize Temple, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm dressed as a trip, so
I knew at a glance.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
That? It's the face
I saw somewhere.

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...Do you get it! Last year, 
you must have come to visit 
Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
No one has returned from the temple
in the last few days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The story of the incident that
happened in the temple has already
reached this village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though <Greybum> is gone, 
it'll be difficult to regain 
the credibility of the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you Straylize 
temple's Pilgrims?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I recognized you right away,
cause you were dressed for the trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
No one has returned from the 
temple in the last few days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The story of the incident that
happened in the temple has

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though <Greybum> is gone, 
It will be difficult to regain the
credibility of the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't help it if I can
show such great power...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, the number of monsters
attacking the city is increasing.
What should I do.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I will do
what I can.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to leave such a lonely
village and go out to the city...
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
It's that trio, Omo, to come
back to this village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're in the city poorly now,
it might be dangerous.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if my life will end without
ever going out to the city...
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll stay in this 
village forever.It's like 
they say, where you live, 
you die.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're going to Straylize Temple,
take the east road.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a lot of priests carrying
big luggage and going down
the road.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that the number of people
who visit the temple has
decreased recently.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The number of people who visit
the temple has increased again.
I'm sure everyone is worried.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
When I find a worshiper, 
I say I'll go to the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
You may be attacked by
a monster and die.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have the Battle Record book?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem reliable enough. 
Here, take this with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
This shows the [Definite Strike] 
coordination that is effective 
against the monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can perform a Definite Strike
by setting [Definite Strike] to 
"ON" from the Customize menu
in the Main menu.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can also view each monster's
Definite Strike in the Monster Book
if Definite Strike is [ON].
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to give anymore. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to say to you now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back once you have honed
your skills some more.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
