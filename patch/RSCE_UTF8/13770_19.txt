You'd like to order some food?
Please wait just a moment!

Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Why, me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
That man again! He forgot to restock.

Is something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
Truthfully... I don't have
what you need to cook.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
My husband just told me he wanted
to leave this city and skipped town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the worst.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wasn't that what you
liked about him then?
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
...W-well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If so, are you going to support
your husband with all you have?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Or you can completely dominate
him and shut him up.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahaha, you have a point. I'm
probably the latter.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't refill your food this time
around. But let me serve you
next time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
What's your name?

Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it strange for a woman dressed
like me to go to the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
The priest's clothes are cute,
aren't they? I'd like to trade
mine for this one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
I was told not to go outside the
village because the monsters are
getting more violent.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been waiting here for so long...
I might as well work here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
I asked the Innkeeper if I could
work for him. But he straight
out refused.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
If I were here, we could
double our sales.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
