<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]

Ahh... A hot spring in the middle
of the snow is quite elegant.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
yeahh~ this is a warrior's rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah... It's good to rest
every now and then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Think <Rutee> and the others
are enjoying this too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, <Mary>, you're really something.
Just what do you eat to get like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Despite it all,
you're so flexible...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... guess it's just in my blood.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
hmph, I'm jealous..At least I've got
<Chelsea> beat, as expected, eh~?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What are you saying!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm still growing you know!
Come on, Miss <Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Teehee, I bet you wouldn't be saying
that if you were 14 too~, hehe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh you~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Philia>, where do
you think you're going!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, please don't run!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No, please, stooop!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ughh! I can't take it anymore!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, my boy. Do you know
why men climb mountains?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't women climb them, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because the mountain is in
front of them! That's why, right?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm...I guess...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're also a man, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's scale this
mountain together!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since I'm your senior here,
I'll go first. Try to keep up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, it'll be fine!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if we get separated,
we'll regroup!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now let's aim for the summit!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
The summit's on the other side of
this wall. You can see it through
this crack right here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
K-<Kongman>, this is awful!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whuh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oooops, sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like <Atwight> slipped out of my
hand and right through that crack~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
GYAAAAAAAAAAA
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you think you were being sneaky,
blurting out your plan like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well ya didn't have to stab
me in the head with a sword!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The men's side is on the left,
the girls side is on the right.
Well then, shall we go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>, No Peeking~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I won't, I promise!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
No need to say anything. 
(When it comes to me, with you
being lightly dressed..hehehe!)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What!? What's with
that creepy look...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Not sure why,
but I feel sick to my stomach.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now now, there's no need
for that, <Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You too <Rutee>.
Let's hurry to the baths.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well, let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haah...This feels incredible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew~..it's so good
for the skin, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmhm, this is a nice hot bath~
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, you sound
like an old man, hehe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't dare show this
side to King <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gyah! C-Cold!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gaahahaha! Whaddaya think?
That was my patented SuperSnowball!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
OUCH! <Johnny>!!
Was that you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, don't you
dare aim that at me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Those guys are
nothin' but children...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>'s also
havin' fun. It's so cute~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what causes men
to act so childish sometimes?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's truly a mystery...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woaah! <Kongman>, that's big!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahahah! You got that right,
<Stahn>! I'm the Champion, after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha, even so, <Stahn>'s
is so small and cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well well, what about <Woodrow>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
WOAHH it's HUUUUGE!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-How could I have lost...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen one so
big in my entire life!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, that was refreshing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps I should invite
<Darzen> next time...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
Why is everyone staring at me like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You look like <Kongman>
before we went into the bath...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, n-nope nothing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's nothing at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with them
all of a sudden?
[ENDBLOCK]

what if you pulled your towel up, and...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Aaah, that was wonderful.

[ENDBLOCK]
