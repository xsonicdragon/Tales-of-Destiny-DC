<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible...!
How could I have...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We won!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've caused us a lot of trouble,
but I think we're finally done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>, it's over. There's no
point in resisting any longer!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take <Igtenos> back
now. <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
You fool! Don't think
you've won so easily!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as I have the Eye of 
Atamoni, I am invincible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
UAAAGGHHH!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No!	He's going to channel the
divine power of the eye
directly into <Igtenos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
His core crystal won't
be able to withstand that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
This sword now contains
the Eye of Atamoni's power!
With this, I will strike you down!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it, <Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Look out, <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ga-gah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a fool.
I saw this coming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. In the end,
he destroyed himself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The glint in the Eye of 
Atamoni has subsided.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew, I was worried
for a moment, there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>, what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why aren't you saying
anything? Answer him!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait. What if he can't
talk, even if he wants to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying
the Swordian was damaged?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Igtenos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems he still has a minimum
amount of functionality, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like he's lost the
ability to communicate at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can he choose <Woodrow>
as his new master?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, he can't do that
in this state.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is terrible...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'd just taken him back
from <Greybum>, too...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there no way to repair him?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
It requires special equipment.
Unfortunately, it doesn't exist
in this day and age.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's just be glad we recovered him.
Thank you, Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We were just doing our job.
There is no need to thank us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, this Eye of Atamoni, 
it's an amazing light.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I felt as if I were being 
swallowed up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was scared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Honestly, I can't believe this is some
kind of lens. It's so glaring.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
So he got what he wanted after all.
I'm sure he'll be very happy, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? What who wanted...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see. You're just
like me, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Answer me. What are
you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Those who don't realize that 
they are just pawns, are happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! <Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Tch, he's gone...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do 
with the Eye of Atamoni, 
take it back to Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what we're supposed to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to use the Draconis
that <Greybum> had to carry it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I should come with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't just leave the Eye 
of Atamoni to Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong with you, <Stahn>?
You look so tense.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know what? Shouldn't we destroy
the Eye of Atamoni, right now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A lot of people have suffered
because of this thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it would be better 
if it didn't exist.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... I know how you
feel, but it's not possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it could be destroyed,
it would have been done
a thousand years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
We couldn't do it, That's
why we went through the trouble
of hiding it from people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll never know unless
you try. It might be different
from a thousand years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll help you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>...
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The existence of the Eye of Atamoni 
has had a negative impact on the 
relations between nations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
As the head of a country, 
I shall carry out the destruction
of the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, I was thinking the
same thing as you, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles> the bishop may be
angry with me, but I think 
this is the right choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll do my best to help you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think she's going
to listen to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It hurts that I can't make money
on a lens this good, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want some idiot
to misuse it again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... are you serious.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I've already decided. I'll do
whatever it takes to destroy it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
... Okay. I'm not going
to stop you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about you, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've forgotten what
our mission was, haven't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you think I would allow you to
go against the <King>'s orders?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, <Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. If we're going to do
this, let's get on with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll help you, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right!	Let's break it down!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No. Not a scratch.
How hard can it be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
As I thought, it's no good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Give up now. There's no 
point in trying any more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shoot.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then we have no choice.
Let's take this to Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've done the best we can.
The big guys will take care 
of the rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. I promise you that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So why don't we just leave it at that?
We've served our original purpose.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Yeah, you're right! Let's go
back to Seinegald with our hearts
on our sleeves!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
