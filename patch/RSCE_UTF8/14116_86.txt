Huh, I know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for that.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What have you learned from

[ENDBLOCK]

I don't like careless people
such as yourselves.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know if you're a 
friend of Master <Fayte> or 
what. but I don't like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I appreciate your help in
rescuing Master <Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want you to go
out with Master <Fayte>.
I'm against it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?	Do 
they hate me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems there's been an
incident at that house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, there's been a bit
of an incident. One of my
soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, And they've been caught.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong with you?
You don't look so good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmm...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't tell me, <Fayte>. Did
this girl attack a soldier!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Fayte>!
I'm not the killer!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> Please believe me too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Surely such a small child. I can't
believe she attacked a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But then again...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
Such a girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear <Johnny>, Please help me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't help you if you
don't help me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, wait. can you
give us a moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Forgive me, but I have
to take this girl into custody.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, why don't you ask around
in the Moreau territory?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There might still be people
who know about the case.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident occurred yesterday 
morning. A soldier was attacked 
here in the Moreau territory.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, there have been a
number  of similar incidents
in the past few days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldier who was attacked
had two scratches on him.
[ENDBLOCK]
soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Based on the testimony of the 
attacked soldier and witnesses.
We arrived at that girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I have an
alibi that I saw the girl at
the time of the incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
I think that's why Master <Fayte> 
gave you all this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story. Would 
you like to hear a synopsis?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the death.
But she was playing with her cat
under the house at that time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The guy that's dressed in
Shiden gear. I'm sure he'll stand
out. Besides he was talking 
to the cat in a big voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Can he really talk to a cat?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a girl? Yeah, I was
at the store at that time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
He was looking for quite a while, and
when I thought he made up his mind
and started to wrap the product, he
said he wanted something different.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
I remember it well, because I've done 
it so many times.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I have an
alibi that I saw the girl at
the time of the incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
I think that's why Master <Fayte> 
gave you all this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story. Would 
you like to hear a synopsis?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Now please go inside
and brief <Fayte> on
the situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... Well, when you do find
the culprit, please come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
As soon as I returned home, I opened
the sliding door and found the boy who
was supposed to be at the port coming
out of the house by the weapons shop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no such thing as a secret
passage in this city that no one 
knows about. It's a mystery.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to hear

[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Since the arrival of the new governor,
the people in the castle have become
a bunch of scary people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I saw him adding
poison to a knife he was carrying.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Moreau's school is the best
in Aquaveil. The royalty of each
territory are also alumni.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It is well known that
<Fayte> and <Johnny>
fought over <Eleanor>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
When I look at <Fayte> and 
<Rihanna> now. I think things
turned out for the best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The school has been closed.
There is no indication of
when it will reopen...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> said that from
now on, we will get along
with other countries.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
The weird thing floating in

bigger and bigger.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

Hey, guys, what did I

Don't tell anyone you're on

no, it's not me.

Everybody, calm down! This is

Oh, here come the tasteless.
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty, King <Tiberius> has
graciously decided to give a speech
upon his return to the country!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>... I'm certain I heard
that name back in Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Something about him conquering
Moreau with <Greybum> as
a military advisor...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go to the port.
Maybe <Greybum> himself
will be there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? The guy that was
singing, where'd he go?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Come with me.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
