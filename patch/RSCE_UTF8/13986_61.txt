You see, I have a
younger brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? Well, OK. Go on.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I overheard mom
and dad talking about him..
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
About how he might not
be my real brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really, now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, let me tell you this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if it's not by blood, 
he's still your brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't really get it...

Heh. It's kinda tough, eh?

Hey sis!

Are you okay? Are you
hurt or anything?
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. My brother and I were fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, I thought about what you
said, and I get it, now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well now, you're
pretty smart, huh!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I was more worried about my brother
than myself when I was running from
the monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
This means we're
really family, right??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you got it!

she told me that she liked me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, uh, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wo-women can forget about the
past without a second thought...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-on the contrary, men seem to
dwell on the past forever you see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
T-this man's behavior is commonly
di-disliked by wo-women...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I see. Well then, I guess I won't
give it a second thought too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, no, but...
that's disliked by women as well...

I was afraid you were
gonna up and abandon me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let's go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>

It was only for a little
while, but I had fun...
[ENDBLOCK]

Well...goodbye, then...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much for
coming with me on my errand!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, just tell me
one thing, would you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just what exactly do you intend
to do with that "Legendary Carrot"?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm gonna smack my big bro
upside the head with it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Upside the head?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! I'm
VERY angry at him!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
He just up and left us
one day wihthout a word!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if he comes crawling back,
I'm not gonna let him off easy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Well, be careful
not to accidentally
kill him, I guess...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got a real harsh mouth, but
you're actually a really sweet guy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph..don't say
such dumb things...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need to go. I have
something I need to do here.

Oh, wait..!

Oh, you're not a monster.

[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man

Wasn't it that savage Muscle
Man who kept the peace in the city.
[ENDBLOCK]

If we were attacked from above,
it would be the same no matter 
where we were.

[ENDBLOCK]
It might be someone from this city
who guided those ruffians.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Ms. <Ilene> from Oberon hasn't
been around for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm more worried this time than
I was when we were attacked by
an armed fleet before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I miss the blue sky.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I hope one day I can walk in the

Whenever I tell her that 
<Kongman> has saved the

increased.

[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope this will be a good opportunity
for the residents to get to know each
other a little better.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
The gap between the rich and the poor
grew wider, and the wind was blowing
harder against Oberon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure Ms. <Ilene> is disappointed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
It's times like this that
we need to unite...
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandmother
[ENDBLOCK]
Without Ms. <Ilene>,
it would be very difficult.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted to show Ms. <Ilene> that
I was working with the residents

Could it be that these monsters

<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a high possibility.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Normally monsters would never
systematically attack a human town.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, evacuate to the

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh no, we've got to get back!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since we've come all this way to
Neuestadt. Why don't we say hello
to <Ilene>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
She may not be there...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We passed through this
city on the way to Lienea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> hasn't been seen
in public for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if she's
going somewhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't have time for
a detour. Let's get to the
port and get on the boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a magnificent town. There are
so many new, beautiful buildings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the Oberon Company funding, 
it looks like there's been a lot of
rapid growth here recently.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea it was this developed...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, did you think it was all rural?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Th-that's?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
S-sorry, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]

Hey, that guy...
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Bacchus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a childhood friend from Lienea.
Wow, what a coincidence!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came to Neuestadt to shop, but
I never thought I'd meet you here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
You took off so suddenly,
It kicked up a huge fuss.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah? yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
In other words, you ran away from
home. You really are something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
So yeah, when are you coming
back to the village?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm probably not coming back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something I have
to do no matter what.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't really tell you the details...
But at any rate, I can't come home 
right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez. If you say it like that,
I'm not gonna ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you should at least write a
letter to your family. <Lilith> is
worried, you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll be going now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, see you around.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't want to needlessly worry
them, so I've kept quiet about
<Greybum>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the right choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't see <Mary> anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where did you go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem stand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you going off and
getting one by yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was yummy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enough, let's get going to
<Ilene>'s estate already.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop! What's
going on here?!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know! Monsters suddenly
came rushing out of the ocean!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
How many were there?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know, they were
all over the place!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>

Damn, where are <Stahn> and the others?
I can't take care of this by myself...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Heh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you laughing about
at a time like this, Chal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no, no. That's right. I wonder
where everyone went.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I'm also worried about <Ilene>.
I hope she's okay...
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> just left for the arena
with a group of people I've never
seen before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?!
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
I wouldn't lie to you about
that. Can I go now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you think the people with <Ilene>,
are <Stahn> and the others?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd rather that be the case. All
right, let's head for the arena.

<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
