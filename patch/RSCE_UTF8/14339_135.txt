[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, the report on the 
damage caused by the recent 
rebellion of <Greybum> is here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I'll read it now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, I've prepared the 
documents for the princess candidates,
please be sure to read through them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sure I want to... 
but I'll take a look.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, the draft of
the military budget for this
year has been finalized.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, I have submitted 
a proposal for the reserves of 
the castle and I hope you will 
take a look at it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I drew everyone 
and His Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow! I'll definitely look at it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
As you know, your father, Isaac,
passed away during the recent
<Greybum> Rebellion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
And your mother passed
 away before that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty was very young when he
lost his mother, and he spent many
days holed up in his room.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
And after three days
and three nights.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
King Isaac dragged His Highness
out of the room by force.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That mild-mannered Lord Isaac?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, and he scolded him severely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
"You have the nation in front of you 
and the people behind you!" He said.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What does that mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the king stops walking, the 
people will stumble and the 
nation will never prosper.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tough life...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Kingship means existing between
a country and its people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why when Master Isaac died, 
he was able to suppress his anger 
and hold back his grief.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
For the country he had to 
escape without looking back
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, what is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like I have work to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
You should have leave 
such matters to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I've been asked to do it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It won't take long, why don't
you wait here for me
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand, 
Do your best
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>, Can I ask
you a question?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened to your
family, <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it looks 
like you're back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry to keep you 
waiting. Now, let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha, yes, just now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm in a hurry to prepare a meal!
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, yes, I understand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if it's like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, what are 
you doing here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Umm, uh, that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm playing queen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not really how you 
manage people in a castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah..
I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Chelsea>. Let's go 
back to the inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, did you enjoy your time
with the queen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
um...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah! It was great!

<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this... a thought trapped in a lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>...
What are you thinking?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
He made me go around the world
unsealing ancient ruins.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
But in hindsight, what was the point!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dammit, I just don't understand...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Aren't you afraid?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did you just say to me!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me, afraid of <Hugo>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, that will never happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been the one using <Hugo>!
From the very beginning!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. But it was bad enough that <Lion>
detected my presence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to make him regret
trying to use me.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
For in the Eye's of Atamoni, I shall 
be king of the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>, you've had us running
around this entire time...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, we were too different.
The other party was <Miktran>, 
you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please hold on a moment.
I'll be right with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You seem really busy.
Maybe I should come back, later.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's you, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please excuse me. I got
a little caught up in a
matter I'm investigating.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's no problem.
What were you looking into?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni sealing facility that
we constructed with the Swordian's advice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The facility that was built
after we defeated <Greybum>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about it, exactly?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's nothing serious, but...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was curious about the guardian
of the Eye that the Swordians 
placed there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's what you
were looking into.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't been able to 
find anything about
this guardian, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>, do you perhaps
know anything about that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Speaking from what I recall, I don't
actually know many details either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
All I know is that the Guardians were
used by people in my age whenever
something needed to be protected.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize if my answer
doesn't tell you much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
At the very least, you've
given me somewhere to start.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry for interrupting
your research. We'll let
you get back to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't give you much of a welcome,
but please make yourself at home, here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...Maybe...I dunno...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! <Lion>! Long 
time no see!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
How've you been?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Getting by.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you have some business
here at the castle?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not really. I just happened
to be near Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aside from that,
what are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was looking
at this portrait.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's portrait is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>'s mother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
His...mother, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was wondering how
I should address her.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oooh! You don't
get it either, <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(Wait, me either?)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
So!	
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's <Woodrow>'s mother!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah, what should I call her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Auntie, perhaps?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Or maybe your Majesty?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I know...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother-in-law!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Teehee!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a long time since you
defeated <Greybum>, hasn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
More importantly, I've heard that
<Woodrow> has taken the throne.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, so you've heard.
Prince <Woodrow> finally
made up his mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, right. I should call him
"King <Woodrow>", now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The country seems more peaceful now.
His rule is clearly taking effect, already.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess it's because of 
<Woodrow>'s humanity.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's not 
the only thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since his ascension, he's been working
hard to make up for his late father.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He is an honorable man who 
never neglects to work hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, have you spoken
to his Majesty, yet?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
If not, you should. He'll
be very happy to see you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty is in his room 
at the end of the corridor.

Rest assured, I will protect the castle

[ENDBLOCK]
I would like to thank you for your
kind attention to His Majesty.

<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Your Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are constantly watching the 
movements of the aerial city in 
our airspace.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't stop Belcrant.
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't stop Belcrant.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Reports are coming in that monsters
have descended on various areas.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
But don't worry. So far, 
we have repelled them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would have loved for His Majesty's 
father to have seen you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would have loved for His 
Majesty's father to have seen 
what you look like now.

[ENDBLOCK]
We are currently gathering 
information on the affected areas
that were directly hit by Belcrant.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
If the light of day continues
to be blocked, it will be fatal
to our country.

The fate of Phandaria rests

I'm worried about him.

Mr. <Alba> has sent a letter to

I am relieved to hear that you

I can't give you much of a welcome,
but please enjoy your time here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, <Lion>.
It's been a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
The portrait on the wall is 
<Woodrow>'s mother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Someday, I'll also be...
Hehehe!~
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a long time, guys.
I'm glad to see you're doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to our castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>? I didn't expect you 
to be here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
After helping out in various ways,
I ended up staying at the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been doing back-breaking 
work to help <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Back...breaking?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It means to do difficult work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, please accept my 
heartfelt congratulations on your 
recent accession to the throne.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no need to be so formal. 
We've been through so much 
together, haven't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want you to call me <Woodrow>,
as you always have.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no probelms with that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
In regards to the Eye of Atamoni.
I can't believe it happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought the facility would be 
attacked by the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any further 
details about it <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Unfortunately, I'm only as aware 
of the situation as you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess we'll just have to ask His 
Majesty of Seinegald directly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's get going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course I'll be coming with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where there is <Woodrow>, 
there is <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice to meet you miss.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it okay for you to leave the 
country even though you just took
the throne?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. I'm leaving
<Darzen> in charge.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
I, <Darzen>, will protect Your
Majesty's absense even at the 
cost of my own life.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the joint responsibility of 
Seinegald and our country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
As one of the parties involved, 
I have a duty to get to the bottom
of this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, Your Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
My apologies, Your Majesty, but
there is something I need you to 
take care of before you depart.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmm, I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You heard the man. I'm sorry.
If you could wait just a moment,
please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow> has a lot of work 
to do, doesn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what kings do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, <Mary>, do you 
have a minute?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are <Mary> and <Chelsea>
going on about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's up?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to ask you a 
straightforward question.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, are you on 
<Woodrow>'s side?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you're worried about the fact 
that I fought against the royal 
army two years ago?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it. That matter 
is no longer an issue.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. We're on the same side.
We'll never be his enemy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... I'm glad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What were you going to do 
if I told you I wasn't?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't it obvious.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
In order to protect <Woodrow>, 
I would shoot you in the heart 
with lightning speed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought you were still a child, 
but well... You've become a fine 
woman.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What were you two talking 
about out here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a secret.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, it's a secret.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Now, let's leave the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
