Calvalese that I know of.

It's forbidden by adults.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Wow. Is this all a 
big pile of trash?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And we'll be here, scavenging.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't put it down. This could be 
a treasure trove of Belselium.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's all split up and 
search this area.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I'll do my best.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<ou don't look so good, <Philia>.

No, it's not...
I'll be fine.

You're obviously not feeling well.

[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you take it 
easy on yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Belselium...
Blue metal...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I found some beautiful rocks.
This is a good one, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]

search for some Belselium?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like <Kongman> got 
trapped underneath the trash.

Ugh... no...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't see anything that looks 
like a Belselium anywhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, this is troubling.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think <Ritora> would specify 
this place without reason.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
But we couldn't find any 
Belselium. This is a fact.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>

No matter how much we
strengthen the Swordians, 
if we can't fix the Draconis...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I can't do...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no?	What did I just say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, if you want, you can
rest outside the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I do that, I won't be able 
to apologize to you all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, but...
You seem to be 
in dire straits...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you guys be so dedicated?
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you really think you 
can handle it now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what I'm thinking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we all work together, we can
surely bring the world back to 
the way it was.
[ENDBLOCK]
Are any of those people, 
us Calvalese?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course the Calvalese people
are included. We're all people of
the same planet.
[ENDBLOCK]
There are caves all over the
place. I'm sure you'll find what 
you're looking for.
[ENDBLOCK]
But it won't be easy. They are
full of toxic gas inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Toxic gas...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Take the neutralizer. As long as 
it works, you won't get gassed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you helping us?
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want you to think that all 
people in Calvalese are the same.
[ENDBLOCK]
Some of us want to change
the future ourselves.
...like me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you...!
[ENDBLOCK]
You can thank me later, but get
going. You don't want to get in
trouble if the others find you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I got it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
How'd it go?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It was... it was there, but 
it wasn't much, so...
[ENDBLOCK]
He...
[ENDBLOCK]
Dad!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Why did you let strangers 
into Trash Mountain?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't blame him.
He only did as we asked.
[ENDBLOCK]
...look over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Belselium!
[ENDBLOCK]
Strangers shouldn't be so unskilled
at searching. Take it.
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on, Dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
We want to change the future 
as much as you do.
[ENDBLOCK]
If you'd been listening to me...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's good. I'm sure 
that'll be enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, gentlemen!
We'll never forget!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm-hm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
So let's get on with it and 
bring back the Belselium.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much. You've 
been a great help.
