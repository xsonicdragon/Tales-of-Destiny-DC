<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell was that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the hover-cruiser. Great
That's what we've been looking for.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're an Oberon executive?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
The name is Shane <Rembrandt>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've met some of you before 
at Master <Hugo>'s mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That time at...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is a guest in the cruiser. 
An important guest entrusted 
to me by the Young Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please give up the cruiser.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean <Marian>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you call her a guest 
when you've taken hostages?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
A guest is a guest is a guest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Rembrandt>! Why are 
you doing this to us?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
What Master <Hugo> wants is what I want.
I hope that's enough of an answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you're blindly following.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you're crazy, man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can say what you want.
I will not be disturbed any longer!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to rescue the
hostage, <Chelsea>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I fought with you not 
only for Master <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a parent myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Ilene> who was in 
Helraios was my daughter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, <Ilene>...
I'm trying to avenge you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, keep your head up. We're not
going to do anything wrong.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I saved the people inside!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go, <Stahn>.
We've got work to do now, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right.
Thanks, <Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Look.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you're okay, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you all for your help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, um,..
Emi, I mean <Lion> is he...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>. you... Are you going
to tell this woman the truth?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion> had other things to do.
We're not together right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, but!	He's fine.
I'm sure he's doing fine...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope <Lion> didn't take a 
wrong turn because of me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
He saw in me the image of his 
mother who had passed away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that I'm a lot
like his mother, ...Chris.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such a me could be a weakness
for that person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't help but worry that he 
might get lost because of me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shouldn't he take his own life first?
I've even thought about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no mistake in what 
...<Lion> has done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He thought of you, he thought of us, 
and he did the right thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So don't tell me you're crying.
...for that guy's sake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I am...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...crying...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't cry, <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know, I know.
But... but...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's send <Marian> to the surface.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's an escape pod here.
You might want to use it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay. <Marian>, come
over here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much 
for everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I beg your pardon.
Are you ...<Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's still...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had heard a lot about you from 
Master <Lion>. You two must have
been very close.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah. He's my
best friend.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure Master <Lion> will 
be pleased to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do when 
you get back to Earth?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I'll be awaiting <Lion>'s
return at the mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what we, the servants, 
are supposed to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go to...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This was ...good, wasn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Finally, all that's left is Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get the cruiser and neutralizers
ready. Let's go now!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
